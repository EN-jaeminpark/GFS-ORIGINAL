Click here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Thursday gave investors a list of stocks that he believes could be worthwhile additions to investors’ portfolios.
All of his picks are listed in the Nasdaq Composite. While the index is heavy with tech stocks that were hammered last year, there are still names that could perform well even in a recessionary environment, according to Cramer.
“In an index that’s been folded, spindled and mutilated, I am still feeling good about a few of these stocks,” he said.
Here are his picks:
T-Mobile
Cramer said that he expects the company to continue taking market share from competitors.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals
“Regeneron’s got a broad pipeline with a ridiculously cheap stock. I think it’s a really, really excellent situation, especially if you’re expecting a severe recession,” he said.
PepsiCo
The beverage giant rivals Procter & Gamble when it comes to the best consumer packaged goods company in the U.S., he said, though he acknowledged that the stock’s valuation is a bit higher than he would like.
American Electric Power
Cramer said that he likes the stock because the company is well-run, and utility stocks tend to perform well during economic slowdowns.
Dollar Tree
While he does like the stock compared to other retailers listed on the Nasdaq, Cramer said that he still prefers TJX Companies
.

Nasdaq closes out its first four-quarter slump since dot-com crash,EST-20224:06-PM,"Predicting a bottom, as all investors know, is a fool’s errand. No two crises are alike, and the economy has changed dramatically since the 2008 housing collapse and even more since the 2000 dot-com crash.
But few market prognosticators are expecting much of a bounce back in 2023. Loup’s Munster said his fund is holding 50% cash, adding that, “if we thought we were at the bottom we’d be deploying today.”
Duncan Davidson, founding partner of venture firm Bullpen Capital, expects more pain ahead as well. He looks at the dot-com era, when it took two years and seven months to go from peak to trough. As of Friday, it’s been just over 13 months since the Nasdaq hit its record price.
For private equity investors, in 2023, “I think we’re going to see a lot of bargain basement snarfing up of companies,” said Davidson, who got started in tech investing in the 1980s. To get to the market bottom, “we may have two years to go,” he said.
WATCH: The IPO market is as bad as it was in 2001The tunnel she’s describing is the continuing rate increases by the Fed, which may only end if the economy enters a recession. Either scenario is troubling for much of technology, which tends to thrive when the economy is in growth mode.
In mid-December, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate to the highest in 15 years, lifting it to a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The rate was anchored near zero through the pandemic as well as in the years that followed the financial crisis.
Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC in late October that more than a decade of zero interest rates “perverted the market” and “allowed manias and asset bubbles to build in every single part of the economy.”
Palihapitiya took as much advantage as anyone of the cheap money available, pioneering investments in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), blank-check entities that hunt for companies to take public through a reverse merger.
With no yield available in fixed income and with tech attracting stratospheric valuations, SPACs took off, raising more than $160 billion on U.S. exchanges in 2021, nearly double the prior year, according to data from SPAC Research. That number sank to $13.4 billion this year. CNBC’s Post-SPAC index
, comprised of the largest companies that have debuted via SPACs in the last two years, lost two-thirds of its value in 2022.Despite the similarities, things are different today.
For the most part, the collapse of 2022 was less about businesses vanishing overnight and had more to do with investors and executives waking up to reality.
Companies are downsizing and getting revalued after a decade of growth fueled by cheap money. With the Fed raising rates to try and get inflation under control, investors have stopped putting a premium on rapid unprofitable growth and started demanding cash generation.
“If you’re looking solely at future cash flows without profitability, those are the companies that did really well in 2020, and those are not as defensible today,” Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer of SVB Private, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Tuesday. “The tech is dead narrative is probably in place for the next couple of quarters,” Saccocia said, adding that some parts of the sector “will have light at the end of this tunnel.”Other than 2008, the only other year worse for the Nasdaq was 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst and the index sank 39%. Early dreams of the internet taking over the world were vaporized. Pets.com, infamous for the sock puppet, went public in February of that year and shut down nine months later. EToys, which held its IPO in 1999 and saw its market cap grow to almost $8 billion, sank in 2000, losing almost all its value before going bankrupt early the next year. Delivery company Kozmo.com never got its IPO off the ground, filing in March 2000 and withdrawing its offering in August.
Amazon
had its worst year ever in 2000, dropping 80%. Cisco
fell 29% and then another 53% the next year. Microsoft
plummeted by more than 60% and Apple by over 70%.
The parallels to today are quite stark.
In 2022, the company formerly known as Facebook
lost roughly two-thirds of its value as investors balked at a future in the metaverse. Tesla
fell by a similar amount, as the carmaker long valued like a tech company crashed into reality. Amazon dropped by half.
The IPO market this year was non-existent, but many of the companies that went public last year at astronomical valuations lost 80% or more of their value.
Perhaps the closest analogy to 2000 was the crypto market this year. Digital currencies Bitcoin
and ether
plunged by more than 60%. Over $2 trillion in value was wiped out as speculators fled crypto. Numerous companies went bankrupt, most notably crypto exchange FTX, which collapsed after reaching a $32 billion valuation earlier in the year. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried now faces criminal fraud charges.
The only major crypto company traded on the Nasdaq is Coinbase
, which went public last year. In 2022, its shares fell 86%, eliminating more than $45 billion in market cap. In total, Nasdaq companies have shed close to $9 trillion in value this year, according to FactSet.
At its peak in 2000, Nasdaq companies were worth about $6.6 trillion in total, and proceeded to lose about $5 trillion of that by the time the market bottomed in October 2002.A lot has changed in technology since the dot-com boom and bust.
The internet went mobile. The data center went to the cloud. Cars are now driving themselves. Chatbots have gotten pretty smart.

Tech’s had a brutal year. But four stocks have a bright future, investor says
Zavier Ong
A DAY AGO
But one thing has remained. When the economy turns, investors rush for the exits. Despite a furious rally on Thursday, the tech-laden Nasdaq finished in the red for a fourth straight quarter, marking the longest such streak since the dot-bomb period of 2000 to 2001. The only other negative four-quarter stretch in the Nasdaq’s five-decade history was in 1983-84, when the video game market crashed.
This year marks the first time the Nasdaq has ever fallen all four quarters. It dropped 9.1% in the first three months of the year, followed by a second-quarter plunge of 22% and a third-quarter decline of 4.1%. It fell 1% in the fourth quarter because of an 8.7% drop in December.
For the full year, the Nasdaq slid 33%, its steepest decline since 2008 and the third-worst year on record. The drop 14 years ago came during the financial meltdown caused by the housing crisis.
“It’s really hard to be positive on tech right now,” Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan on Wednesday. “You feel like you’re missing something. You feel like you’re not getting the joke.”The Nasdaq closed out its worst year since 2008 and is mired in a downturn that’s drawing many comparisons to the dot-com crash.
“It’s really hard to be positive on tech right now,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1% in the fourth quarter, wrapping up its first four-quarter losing streak since 2000-2001."
The Nasdaq had its worst year since 2008. These are the best and worst performers and what to expect in 2023,EST-202210:41-AM,
Las acciones cierran al alza en el rally de fin de año. Nasdaq suma más de 2%.,EST-20225:42-PM,"Las acciones subieron el jueves a medida que los inversores se enfrentan a los últimos días de negociación de 2022.
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones subió 345.09 puntos, o un 1.05%, para terminar la sesión en 33,220.80, recuperando casi todas sus pérdidas de la sesión anterior. El S&P 500 ganó un 1.75% para cerrar en 3,849.28, y el Nasdaq Composite subió un 2.59% a 10,478.09.
El Dow y el S&P están ligeramente al alza en la semana, un 0.05% y un 0.12%, respectivamente. Mientras que el Nasdaq va en camino a una semana con pérdidas del 0.19%.
Louis Navellier, fundador y director de inversiones de la firma de inversión en crecimiento Navellier & Associates, calificó los movimientos del jueves como una “versión abreviada de un día de un rally de Santa.”
“Estábamos atrasados para un repunte, y gran parte de la debilidad reciente puede explicarse por una mayor venta de pérdidas fiscales una vez que Santa Rally no se materializó,” dijo. “Tendremos más volatilidad en el nuevo año con mucha incertidumbre sobre si es posible un aterrizaje suave y, si no, cuánta determinación tendrá la Fed para no oscilar si nos acercamos hacia una recesión grave.”
Las acciones de Apple se recuperaron después de cuatro días consecutivos de pérdidas, subiendo un 2.83%.
El mercado subió temprano el jueves después de que el Departamento de Trabajo informara un aumento en las solicitudes de desempleo de la semana pasada, en medio de los esfuerzos de la Reserva Federal para enfriar la economía y, en particular, el mercado laboral.
Las solicitudes de beneficios por desempleo por primera vez totalizaron 225,000 para la semana que finalizó el 24 de diciembre, según el informe. Marcando un aumento de 9,000 solicitudes, con respecto a la semana anterior y ligeramente por encima de la estimación de 223,000 de Dow Jones.
“El mercado pareció apreciar que el informe de empleos mostró un modesto aumento en las continuas solicitudes de desempleo, en línea con las expectativas y proporcionando una pepita de evidencia de que es posible un aterrizaje suave”, dijo Jason Blackwell, estratega jefe de inversiones de The Colony Group.
Los principales promedios se dirigen hacia su peor año desde 2008. El Dow ha perdido un 8.58%, mientras que el S&P 500 ha tenido una pérdida del 19.24%. Mientras tanto, el Nasdaq es el más rezagado de los tres, con una caída del 33.03%, ya que los inversores abandonaron las acciones de crecimiento en medio de las crecientes tasas de interés.
“Los inversores anticipan que una recesión económica se materializará a principios de 2023, como lo demuestran las tres cuartas partes de las disminuciones proyectadas de las ganancias del S&P 500 y las continuas inclinaciones del sector defensivo”, dijo Sam Stovall, estratega jefe de inversiones de CFRA Research. “La gravedad de la recesión sigue en duda. Esperamos que sea leve.”

"S&P 500 y Nasdaq cierran al alza sesión del viernes, pero caen por tercera semana consecutiva",EST-20224:38-PM,"El S&P 500 y el Nasdaq Composite subieron el viernes, pero aun así registraron una pérdida semanal debido a que los temores de una recesión continúan afectando la confianza de los inversores.
El S&P 500 subió un 0.6% a 3,844.82, mientras que el Nasdaq Composite sumó un 0.2% para cerrar en 10,497.86. El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones cerró 176.44 puntos más alto, o un 0.5%, cerrando la sesión en 33,203.93 unidades.
Los principales índices de Wall Street oscilaron más temprano en la sesión después de que el índice de precios de gastos de consumo personal subyacente, el indicador preferido de inflación de la Reserva Federal (la Fed), se mantuvo ligeramente más caliente de lo que los economistas esperaban en términos de año tras año, lo que indica que la inflación se está estancando a pesar de los esfuerzos de la Fed para combatirla.
“Las cifras económicas anunciadas hoy resaltan la dificultad para los inversores hoy en día, donde las cifras débiles traen temores de recesión y las cifras fuertes traen temores de la Fed”, dijo Louis Navellier, fundador y director de inversiones de la firma de inversión en crecimiento Navellier & Associates.
“Simplemente no puedes ganar en este momento con números macro,” agregó. “Es por eso que ahora es mucho más un mercado de selección de acciones, pero con todos los comerciantes de índices y ETF, incluso las acciones que están ejecutando bien su plan de negocios pueden verse empujadas significativamente por los perdedores asociados.”
El S&P 500 terminó la semana con una caída de alrededor del 0.2% durante la semana, registrando su tercer descenso semanal consecutivo. El Nasdaq Composite perdió un 2% durante la semana. Por otro lado, el Dow tuvo el mejor desempeño, registrando una ganancia del 0.9%.
Los temores a una recesión han resurgido recientemente, lo que ha frustrado la esperanza de algunos inversores de un repunte de fin de año y ha provocado grandes pérdidas para el mes de diciembre. A los inversores les preocupa que el endurecimiento excesivo de los bancos centrales de todo el mundo pueda llevar a la economía a una recesión.
Para diciembre, el S&P 500 ha perdido un 5.8%, mientras que el Dow y el Nasdaq han perdido más de un 4% y un 8.5%, respectivamente. Los mayores descensos mensuales para los principales promedios desde septiembre. Las acciones también están en camino a su peor desempeño anual desde 2008.

S&P 500 y Nasdaq cierran el viernes a la baja tras informe de empleo; índices registran ganancias semanales,EST-20225:45-PM,"Las acciones redujeron algunas pérdidas en las operaciones de la tarde después de caer debido a los datos laborales, mientras los inversores esperan la próxima reunión de la Reserva Federal.
El promedio industrial Dow Jones cerró en números verdes con un alza de 34.87 puntos, o un 0.1%, terminando en 34,429.88. Por otro lado, el S&P 500 cayó un 0.1% a 4,071.70, recuperándose de una pérdida anterior del 1.2%. Mientras que el Nasdaq Composite, enfocado en la tecnología, recuperó terreno, pero aún así cerró casi un 0.2% a la baja, terminando la sesión en 11,461.50 puntos. El índice de alta tecnología cayó un 1.6% en un punto durante el día, pero logró sobreponerse. 
Los tres índices registraron ganancias semanales, con el Nasdaq registrando el mayor aumento semanal con un alza de casi 2.1%. El cierre del viernes marcó la primera vez que los tres índices principales registran ganancias semanales consecutivas desde octubre.
Las acciones cayeron después de que los datos laborales publicados el viernes por la mañana mostraron que las nóminas no agrícolas aumentaron 263,000 en noviembre, una ganancia mayor que el aumento de 200,000 esperado por los economistas encuestados por Dow Jones. La tasa de desempleo se mantuvo estable en 3.7%. Los ingresos medios por hora también superaron las expectativas, con un aumento del 0.6% mensual y un 5,1% en comparación con el mismo mes del año anterior.
Pero el mercado puso fin a algunas de esas pérdidas en las horas posteriores. Los observadores del mercado atribuyeron la medida a que los inversores son cada vez más capaces de sacudirse los indicadores económicos individuales tras los comentarios del miércoles del presidente de la Fed, Jerome Powell, que parecían confirmar la desaceleración de las subidas de tipos a partir de diciembre.
“Un solo dato laboral sólido no será suficiente después del discurso de Powell”, dijo Anna Han, vicepresidenta de Wells Fargo Securities. “Está confirmando que estamos viendo la tendencia de que estamos teniendo un impacto en la inflación, así que creo que eso calma al mercado y quita presión”.
Fue el último informe mensual de empleo antes de la reunión de dos días de la Fed del 13 al 14 de diciembre, en la que se espera que el banco central apruebe un aumento de la tasa de interés de 50 puntos básicos.

El Nasdaq Composite perdió un 0.59% para cerrar en 10,983.78. Mientras que el S&P 500 perdió un 0.16%, finalizando el día en 3,957.63. Por otro lado, el Promedio Industrial Dow Jones, enfocado en la tecnología, registró una ganancia mínima de 3.07 puntos, cerrando la sesión un 0.01% más alto en 33,852.53.
Los inversores están atentos a los datos que llegarán más adelante esta semana, incluidas las ofertas de trabajo de JOLTS el miércoles y las nóminas de noviembre el viernes, para conocer el desempeño de la economía.
Además, esperan el discurso programado del presidente de la Reserva Federal, Jerome Powell, en el Centro Hutchins de Política Fiscal y Monetaria en Brookings el miércoles para obtener pistas sobre si el Banco Central desacelerará o detendrá las alzas de tasas de interés.
“El mercado ha cambiado el enfoque de la conclusión de la temporada de informes de ganancias del tercer trimestre a factores adicionales que probablemente influirán a la Reserva Federal en sus deliberaciones de diciembre”, dijo Bill Northey, director senior de inversiones de U. S. Bank. “Los inversores están claramente enfocados en el camino por delante en lugar de mirar por el espejo retrovisor.”
Las cifras a la baja del martes siguen a las fuertes pérdidas del lunes, después de que las protestas en China continental contra la política de cero Covid del país comenzaron el fin de semana. Las protestas elevaron las preocupaciones sobre el efecto que los protocolos chinos para controlar el Covid podrían causar nuevamente en las cadenas de suministro globales.

El S&P 500 y el Nasdaq cierran más bajos por segundo día mientras los inversionistas analizan los comentarios de los oficiales de la Reserva Federal,EST-20225:27-PM,"Las acciones cayeron el jueves y los rendimientos de los bonos aumentaron mientras los oficiales de la Reserva Federal señalaron que su campaña de los aumentos a las tasas de interés para detener la inflación no está por acabar. 
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones perdió 7.51 puntos, o un 0.02% para terminar la sesión en 33,546.32-después de haber caído tanto como 314 puntos en la sesión. El S&P 500 cayó un 0.31% a 3,946.56, mientras el Nasdaq Composite vio un declive de un 0.35% cerrando la sesión en 11,144.96. 
Las acciones repuntaron de los mínimos de la mañana luego de que las acciones de Cisco Systems saltaron casi un 5%. La empresa de equipo de red sobrepasó las expectativas en su reporte fiscal del primer trimestre y también emitió guías optimistas. Otras acciones de tecnología como Intel y Apple también saltaron.
Los inversionistas analizaron los comentarios del Presidente de la Reserva Federal de St. Louis James Bullard, quien dijo en un discurso el jueves que “la política sobre las tasas aún no está en una zona que podría ser considerada suficientemente restrictiva.”
“El cambio en la posición de la política monetaria parece haber tenido solo un impacto limitado en la inflación observada, pero los precios del mercado sugieren que la desinflación es esperada en el 2023,” dijo Bullard.
El rendimiento al Tesoro de 2-años que es sensible a la política saltó al 4.45% el jueves, alzando los temores de que las altas tasas de interés podrían mandar a la economía hacia una recesión.
“Estoy viendo al mercado laboral de ahora que está muy apretada, no se como continuas a bajar este nivel de inflación sin tener alguna desaceleración real, y alomejor tenemos contracción en la economía para llegar hacia ahí,” le dijo la Presidenta de la Reserva Federal de Kansas City Esther George al Wall Street Journal el miercoles. 
Las acciones vulnerables a la recesión y las tasas altas fueron los de peor rendimiento en el S&P 500.
“Endurecimiento monetaria adicional y el impacto cumulativo de los aumentos a las tasas de este año sugieren que los riesgos de una recesión siguen elevadas,” escribió Mark Haefele, director de inversiones en UBS Global Wealth en una nota. “Seguimos creyendo que las predicciones macroeconómicas para un repunte sostenible — que los cortes a las tasas de interés y un descenso en el crecimiento y ganancias corporativas están por venir — aún no están en lugar.”

El S&P 500 y el Nasdaq cierran a la baja rompiendo un rally de dos días,EST-20225:14-PM,"Las acciones cayeron al comienzo de la semana, ya que los inversores se tomaron una pausa del gran repunte de la semana pasada.
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones cayó 211.16 puntos, o un 0.6%, a 33,536.70. Por otro lado, el S&P 500 bajó un 0.89% a 3,957.25, mientras que el Nasdaq Composite, enfocado en la tecnología, cayó un 1.12% a 11,196.22. El comercio estuvo agitado durante el día.
“Esta semana marca un poco de calma informativa para los mercados, ya que pasamos la peor parte de la temporada de ganancias del tercer trimestre, pasamos el diluvio de datos económicos de fin de mes/inicio de mes, la ajetreada temporada navideña está a punto de comenzar y estamos a solo siete semanas de 2023,” dijo Chris Hussey, de Goldman Sachs.
“Pero a raíz de la alentadora publicación del IPC del jueves pasado, los mercados están contemplando el panorama macro, la posibilidad de que la inflación finalmente haya alcanzado su punto máximo, el camino de las tasas a partir de aquí, así como la posibilidad de una recesión,” dijo.
Los principales índices bursátiles salieron de sus mínimos después de que la vicepresidenta de la Reserva Federal, Lael Brainard, indicó que el banco central pronto podría desacelerar el ritmo de sus aumentos de tasas de interés y brindar cierto consuelo al mercado.
Los comentarios de Brainard se produjeron después de que el gobernador del banco central, Christopher Waller, dijera el domingo que el punto final para la tasa de fondos de la Reserva Federal “todavía está lejos.” Sus comentarios inicialmente pesaron en el mercado.
Antes de los comentarios de Brainard, las acciones cayeron brevemente cerca de los mínimos de la sesión luego de los informes de que Amazon despedirá a unos 10,000 empleados esta semana. Casi al mismo tiempo, una encuesta de la Reserva Federal mostró que las expectativas de inflación de los consumidores para el próximo año aumentaron, lo que pesó más en el sentimiento.
 El S&P 500 repuntó un 5.9% para cerrar la semana pasada con su mejor avance semanal desde junio. Los inversionistas aplaudieron una lectura de inflación menor a la esperada, apostando a que la Reserva Federal pronto desacelerará su agresiva campaña de ajuste.
La temporada de ganancias del tercer trimestre continuará, con un fuerte enfoque en el comercio minorista. Las grandes compañías de comercio Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe ’s, Macy’s y Kohl’s están programadas para publicar sus números esta semana.

"Las acciones cierran más bajos por cuarto día, el Nasdaq pierde un 1.7% mientras se avecina el reporte de empleo de Octubre",EDT-20225:05-PM,"La atención de los inversionistas el jueves giró hacia las nóminas no agrícolas del mes de octubre, esperando salir el viernes. Un fuerte número de empleos y una tasa baja de desempleo, aunque buenos para la economía, podría señalar más trabajo en el futuro para la Reserva Federal. 
“El desempleo necesita subir para que la inflación baje,” dijo Adam Sarhan, Director General de 50 Park Investments. “Eso es la realidad- pies en la tierra. Las personas van a parar de comprar y consumir tantos bienes y servicios cuando no tienen trabajo.” 
Otra pista sobre la inflación vendrá la próxima semana en el reporte del índice de precios al consumidor.
Por otro lado, la temporada de ganancias corporativas continuó, con Qualcomm, Roku y Fortinet cayendo debido a resultados trimestrales decepcionantes.
Para la semana, todos los índices principales están en camino hacia pérdidas, con el Dow y el S&P en declive un 2.62% y un 4.64% respectivamente. El Nasdaq ha caído un 6.84%, poniéndolo en paso para su peor semana desde enero de 2022.
Desde el cierre del jueves, el Dow está en camino de romper una racha de ganancias de cuatro semanas, mientras que el Dow y el S&P 500 y el Nasdaq están en camino de romper una racha de ganancias de dos semanas.

Traducido por Jennifer GarciaLas acciones cayeron el jueves por cuarto día consecutivo. La caída viene un día después de que la Reserva Federal anunció otro aumento de tres cuartos puntos a las tasas de interés, y también señaló que un giro a su estrategia de endurecimiento no está por venir pronto.
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones perdió 146.51 puntos o un 0.46% para terminar en 32,001.25. El S&P 500 cayó un 1.06% a 3,719.89, mientras el Nasdaq Composite vio un declive de un 1.73% para cerrar la sesión en 10,342.94.
Los rendimientos aumentaron luego de que los inversionistas analizaron la decisión más reciente acerca de las tasas, poniendo presión sobre las acciones. El rendimiento del Tesoro a 2-años llegó a su nivel más alto desde julio de 2007, mientras que el rendimiento del Tesoro a 10-años subió casi 9 puntos básicos a un 4.15%.
Los comerciantes habían anticipado el aumento de 0.75 puntos de porcentaje del banco central, e inicialmente vieron el comunicado de la Reserva Federal como dócil, sugiriendo aumentos más pequeños en el futuro.
Al principio, eso mandó a las acciones hacia arriba el miércoles, pero esas ganancias fueron reversadas cuando el Presidente de la Reserva Federal Jerome Powell dijo que era “prematuro” discutir una pausa a los aumentos a las tasas, y que el supuesto “tasa final,” o el nivel en cual las tasas llegan a su máximo, podría ser más alto de lo que la Reserva Federal había anunciado previamente.
“Aún tenemos un camino por recorrer y nuevos datos desde nuestra última reunión que sugieren que el último nivel de las tasas de interés será más alto que lo esperado,” dijo Powell.
Muchos esperan que el mercado continuará oscilando hasta que esté claro que la inflación ha deteriorado y que la Reserva Federal terminará sus aumentos."
"El S&P 500 cierra más bajo mientras la advertencia de Target pesa sobre las acciones de venta al por menor, el Nasdaq cae un 1.5%",EST-20225:08-PM,"El S&P 500 cayó el miércoles mientras los inversionistas analizaron una actualización sombría del trimestre de fiestas de fin de año de parte de Target, que presionó las acciones de venta al por menor.
El S&P 500 cayó un 0.83% a 3,958.79 y el Nasdaq Composite vio un declive de un 1.5% terminando en 11,183.66. El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones combatió con la línea plana todo el día, pero terminó la sesión con una pérdida de 39.09 puntos, o un 0.12% en 33,553.83.
Estos movimientos vienen después de que Target reportó un declive en sus ventas, ya que las familias están lidiando con la inflación alta frente a la mayor temporada de compras del año para las tiendas de venta al por menor. La advertencia pesó sobre las acciones, mandando a Target hacia abajo un 13%, su peor día desde mayo. Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s y Gap también vieron grandes declives. 
“Una temporada volátil de ganancias para las ventas al por menor está haciendo que los inversionistas sean puntillosos y particulares en su exposición de venta minorista, mientras la diferencia entre los almacenes grandes y las ventas minoristas especializadas continúa a ampliarse,” dijo Jeff Kilburg, fundador y director general de KKM Financial. 
Brian Levitt, estratega de mercado global en Invesco, lo llamó una imagen mixta, notando que los datos de venta al por menor publicadas antes en el día estaban en desacuerdo con la advertencia de Target.
“Los datos del comercio minorista sugieren que los consumidores aún están dispuestos a gastar, especialmente en artículos de gran consumo, mientras Target advirtió de una temporada de fiestas de fin de año más débil,” dijo Levitt. “Este último es más en línea con nuestras expectativas. Una política monetaria más dura está diseñada para hacer que las personas se sientan menos ricas. La idea es desacelerar la consumption, permitiendo que la inflación modere. Irónicamente, eso también nos prepara para la recuperación.”
Las acciones han tenido un rendimiento fuerte después del reporte del informe del índice de precios al consumidor mejor que esperado. El S&P 500 vio su mejor semana desde junio la semana pasada, y todos los índices principales están en camino de terminar el mes con ganancias.

Bitcoin’s volatility falls below Nasdaq and S&P 500′s for first time since 2020,EDT-20224:27-PM,"“Even though we have seen some signs of declining housing market demands and slower inflation this week, the market is on high alert for next month’s FOMC meeting and ignoring those economic data that could justify a more cautious approach to rate hikes,” said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese crypto exchange Bitbank.
“We will likely not see any big movement until the meeting,” he added. “However, the area around $19,000 will likely continue to be a support for the price of bitcoin.”

End of interactive chart.While bitcoin’s price is stuck lately, there is one good thing to come from it for investors betting on crypto to become a legitimate asset class: It’s less of a wild ride.
After hovering in the $19,000 level for more than a month, bitcoin’s volatility is now lower than that of both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, according to Kaiko.
The data provider said Friday that the cryptocurrency’s 20-day rolling volatility has now fallen below that of the stock indexes for the first time since 2020. On Monday it had fallen enough just to match the Nasdaq’s volatility. That’s welcome news to many longtime crypto investors who hope that a mellowing of crypto’s notorious price swings could bring less fear to potential new investors.
Kaiko also said the gap between bitcoin’s and equities’ 30-day and 90-day volatilities has been shrinking since the middle of September, even with bitcoin’s heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic data releases. (Though bitcoin’s correlation with stocks has eased, it remains high and its price continues to be driven by macro themes.)
“Bitcoin volatility is at multi-year lows while equity volatility is only at its lowest level since July,” Clara Medalie, head of research at Kaiko, told CNBC. “Equity markets have certainly been volatile over the past few months due to high inflation, an appreciating dollar, rising interest rates, and the ongoing war and energy crisis. The data suggests that cryptocurrency markets are less reactive to volatile macro events than they were earlier on in the year, whereas equity markets have remained highly sensitive.”
On Friday bitcoin briefly fell below the $19,000 level, following a brief spike in the dollar index and as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 14-year peak. It has since rebounded, however.
The bitcoin price was last higher by 0.7% at $19,189, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day it fell as low as $18,677.50. Ether added 1.4% to trade at $1,302.40, after finding an earlier low of $1,254.80.
On Friday the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 4.308% for the first time since 2008 but pulled back after a report that some Federal Reserve officials are concerned about overtightening with rate hikes. The dollar index also briefly jumped to a session high of 113.906 before losing most of its gains.
The two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap are on pace to post a down week and their third negative week in a row, in what is historically a strong month for crypto returns. For the month, bitcoin and ether are down about 1% and 3%, respectively."
El Nasdaq rompe racha de ganancias de tres días mientras la tecnología pesa sobre los índices,EDT-20225:35-PM,"El Nasdaq Composite y el S&P 500 cayeron el miércoles, con los dos índices rompiendo rachas de ganancias de tres días, mientras los inversionistas analizaban las ganancias decepcionantes de parte de los gigantes de la tecnología Microsoft y Alphabet.
El Nasdaq cayó un 2.04% para cerrar en 10,970.99. El S&P 500 cayó un 0.74% a 3,830.60. El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones de 30-acciones subió por 2.37 puntos para terminar el día en 31,839.11. 
Las acciones intentaron un repunte más temprano en el día, con los inversionistas tratando de sacudir los resultados trimestrales de Microsoft y Alphabet. En cierto punto, el Dow repuntó más de 300 puntos ya que Visa apoyó el índice con ganancias fuertes. 
Las acciones de Alphabet, la empresa matriz de Google, cayeron un 9.1% después de que el gigante de la tecnología no alcanzó las expectativas en las líneas altas y bajas. Alphabet también reportó un declive en ingresos por medio de anuncios en YouTube.
Mientras tanto, Microsoft vio un declive de un 7.7% después de que el gigante tecnológico reportó ganancias más débiles que lo esperado por medio del ‘cloud’ en sus resultados trimestrales más recientes, a pesar de sobrepasar las estimaciones de ganancias e ingresos. La empresa también emitió una guía de ganancias trimestrales actualizada que también cayó corta de las expectativas.
Las oscilaciones en los índices principales reflejan una “lucha de la cuerda” entre América corporativa y la Reserva Federal que ha dejado a los inversionistas con el deber de intentar balancear lo que las empresas están reportando, y lo que eso significa para futuros aumentos a la tasa de interés, dijo Keith Buchanan, administrador de cartera en GLOBALT Investments. El dijo que los primeros reportes de tecnología tuvieron un impacto particular ya que es una industria al cual muchos inversionistas están expuestos. 
En otras noticias, las acciones de Harley-Davidson subieron un 12.6% después de que el fabricante de motocicletas reportó sobrepasar las expectativas antes de la campana. Boeing perdió casi un 8.8% luego que el fabricante de jets reportó pérdidas trimestrales y no logró alcanzar las expectativas de ganancias.

Procter & Gamble
(PG) – The consumer products giant’s quarterly earnings of $1.57 per share beat estimates by 3 cents with revenue also topping Wall Street forecasts.

Travelers
(TRV) – Travelers added 1% in premarket trading after beating top and bottom line estimates for its latest quarter. The insurance company’s catastrophe losses rose from a year ago, but its results were helped by record insurance premiums.

"El Dow cierra casi 200 puntos mas alto gracias a un informe PIB mejor que esperado, el Nasdaq cae",EDT-20225:24-PM,"El Promedio Industrial Dow cerró más alto el jueves después de que nuevos datos mostraron que el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) creció más rápido que lo esperado en el tercer trimestre, e insinuó una disminución en la inflación, animando a los inversionistas a comprar acciones vinculadas con la salud de la economía.
El Dow subió 194.17 puntos o un 0.6% para cerrar en 32,033.28 para su quinto día de ganancias. Las acciones de Caterpillar, McDonald’s y Honeywell dirigieron el índice de 30-acciones hacia arriba después de que las empresas reportaron ganancias mejores que lo esperado.

El S&P 500 cayó un 0.6% a 3,807.30. El Nasdaq perdió un 1.6% para terminar la sesión en 10,792.68 mientras un declive en Meta y otras acciones tecnológicas pesaron sobre el índice.
La economía estadounidense creció un 2.6% a un paso anualizado en este periodo, un 0.3% más alto que la estimación del Dow Jones de un crecimiento de un 2.3% según un reporte de la Oficina de Análisis Económico. El índice de precios ponderado en cadena, una medida del coste de la vida que es ajustada para reflejar los cambios en el comportamiento del consumidor, subió un 4.1% para el trimestre, muy por debajo de la estimación de un 5.3%. La inflación general aumentó un 4.2%, un fuerte descenso de un 7.3% de acuerdo con el indicador que usa la Reserva Federal.
Esto le ofreció esperanza para los observadores del mercado buscando datos que indiquen que la inflación está disminuyendo, lo que podría llevar a la Reserva Federal a aliviar los aumentos a las tasas después de su reunión en noviembre, dijo Cliff Hodge, director de inversiones en Cornerstone Wealth. Los rendimientos de los bonos también cayeron después de la publicación de estos datos. Hodge agregó que “esto es otro signo señalando la probabilidad que los peores niveles de la inflación hayan pasado.”  
Aun así, el sector de la tecnología continuó con sus recientes caídas. Las acciones de Meta cayeron casi un 24.6% debido a un pronóstico débil para el cuarto trimestre, y ganancias decepcionantes en el tercer trimestre reportados el miércoles. La empresa también dijo que estaría perdiendo más dinero el próximo año construyendo el ‘metaverse.’ El reporte llevó a que varios analistas bajaran la categoría de las acciones.

A China ‘spending boom?’ Your guide to emerging market investing in 2023
Goldman Sachs reveals outlook for Greater China tech – and names its top picks for 2023Washington and Beijing reached a deal in August to allow the U.S. to conduct inspections within China’s borders, a move that was seen as a positive step toward a solution to the audit dispute that escalated in recent years.
China sent regulators to assist inspectors from the U.S.’s Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Hong Kong, Reuters reported last week, citing unnamed sources.
“I don’t want to jump the gun,” McCooey told CNBC. But if U.S. regulators are comfortable with the audit workpapers in Hong Kong, “that will take the risk out of [Chinese] companies being delisted.”Some 30 Chinese companies went public on the Nasdaq in the first half of 2021, McCooey said.
In contrast, only two Chinese companies listed on the Nasdaq in the second half of that year, and one Chinese company debuted on the exchange from January to March this year, according to CNBC’s analysis of data from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
But things are looking up.
“I can say that it’s north of 50 companies that would like to come public on Nasdaq in the next 12 months,” McCooey said.The Nasdaq is expecting more Chinese companies to list on the U.S. exchange in the coming months as Beijing and Washington appear closer to resolving an audit dispute.
“We still have a pretty strong pipeline … as things are getting to become a little more clear in that market. We think that that market could pick up pretty dramatically,” said Bob McCooey, vice chairman of Nasdaq, who does business development in the Asia-Pacific, told CNBC on Wednesday.
The market for Chinese initial public offerings “pretty much [shut] down” in light of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and the noise around Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, he told “Street Signs Asia.”
Delisting risk for U.S.-listed Chinese companies sharply increased following the signing of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act in late 2020.
The law allows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to kick Chinese companies off American stock exchanges if American regulators are not able to review company audits for three years in a row.
Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi’s announcement of plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange in late 2021 — just six months after its U.S. IPO — also fueled investor concerns. Didi was subjected to a cybersecurity probe from Chinese regulators soon after its IPO. Didi also faced an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The Nasdaq has a “very, very strong” pipeline of Chinese companies that want to list on the exchange in the coming months as the U.S. and China appear closer to resolving an audit dispute, said Bob McCooey, vice chairman of Nasdaq.
Some 30 Chinese companies went public on the Nasdaq in the first half of 2021, he said.

Rocket builder Astra Space gets delisting warning from Nasdaq,EDT-20225:16-PM,"Embattled small rocket-builder Astra revealed Friday that it received a delisting warning from the Nasdaq after its stock spent 30 consecutive days below $1 per share, a violation of the exchange’s requirements.
The company has 180 days to lift its share price or face delisting, according to a regulatory filing.
Astra stock closed Friday at 59 cents per share, down more than 90% this year and more than 95% off its 52-week high of $13.58. The company debuted on the Nasdaq in July 2021 via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company.
Astra did not immediately return request for comment Friday on the delisting warning.
The rocket builder has been saddled with quarterly losses and in August said it was pausing flights for the remainder of the year.
“Whether we’ll be able to commence commercial launches in 2023 will depend on the success of our test flights” for a new rocket system, CEO Chris Kemp said during the company’s second-quarter conference call.
Astra is also facing a Federal Aviation Administration investigation into a failed rocket launch in June that was carrying a pair of satellites for NASA’s TROPICS-1 mission. The company was unable to deliver the satellites to orbit, and NASA put the remaining two launches it had contracted from Astra on hold.

Dow cae 600 puntos y el Nasdaq cierra un 3% más bajo a medida que las tasas suben,EDT-20224:57-PM,"Las acciones cayeron el viernes mientras los operadores evaluaban el informe de empleo de septiembre, que mostró que la tasa de desempleo continúa disminuyendo y provocó un aumento en las tasas de interés.
El promedio industrial Dow Jones cayó 630.15 puntos, o un 2.1%, a 29,296.79. El S&P 500 perdió un 2.8% a 3,639.66. Mientras que el Nasdaq Composite cayó un 3.8% a 10,652.41, menos de un 1% por encima de su mínimo del año.
Las cifras de empleo del viernes mostraron que la economía de Estados Unidos agregó 263.000 empleos en septiembre, ligeramente por debajo de una estimación del Dow Jones de 275,000. Sin embargo, la tasa de desempleo se situó en 3,5%, por debajo del 3,7% del mes anterior, en una señal de que el panorama laboral continúa fortaleciéndose incluso cuando la Reserva Federal intenta desacelerar la economía con alzas de tasas para frenar la inflación.
“Si bien los datos fueron los esperados, la caída en la tasa de desempleo es aparentemente lo que obsesiona a los mercados debido a lo que significa para la Reserva Federal”, dijo Peter Boockvar, director de inversiones de Bleakley Financial. “Cuando se combina con el bajo nivel de solicitudes iniciales de desempleo, el ritmo de los despidos sigue siendo lento y esto, por supuesto, hace que la Fed se entusiasme por continuar con sus agresivas alzas de tasas.”
La caída de la tasa de desempleo provocó un salto en las tasas, lo que a su vez pesó sobre las acciones. El rendimiento del Tesoro a 2 años aumentó 6 puntos básicos a 4,316%. (1 punto básico es igual al 0,01%.)

Wall Street cerró una de sus peores semanas en meses y los operadores reaccionaron a una fea advertencia de ganancias de FedEx sobre la economía global.
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones cayó 139.40 puntos, o un 0.45%, para cerrar en 30,822.42. El S&P 500 perdió un 0.72% para cerrar la semana en 3,873.33. El Nasdaq cayó un 0.90% para cerrar en 11,448.40. Fue la peor semana para el S&P 500 y el Nasdaq desde junio.
Las acciones de FedEx se desplomaron un 21.4 %, su peor caída diaria hasta el momento, luego de que la empresa de envíos retiró su guía para todo el año y dijo que implementará iniciativas de reducción de costos para lidiar con volúmenes de envíos globales débiles a raíz de que la economía global “empeoró significativamente.”
Las acciones de transporte suelen considerarse un indicador del mercado de valores, así como de la economía, y FedEx señaló la debilidad en Asia como una de las principales razones de su perspectiva negativa. Las acciones de los rivales de envío UPS y XPO Logistics cayeron casi un 4.5% y un 4.7%, respectivamente, y las acciones de Amazon cayeron un 2.1%.
El anuncio de FedEx se produjo poco después de un informe de inflación más alto de lo esperado en los EE.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comCramer said in six of the seven meme-stock resurgences he identified, the Nasdaq had a meaningful pullback in the weeks that followed. It doesn’t matter that some of the biggest meme stocks, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, are not even listed on the Nasdaq. While the severity of the downturns varies, he said on average the Nasdaq decline was about 12%, the level where Cramer suggested it might be time to put money to work.
“I know the connection might seem a little tenuous to you. Why would meme stock rallies signal that stocks are peaking? Because it’s a textbook sign of froth. It shows you that the bulls are getting complacent, and speculation is running rampant,” Cramer said.
Part of the selling pressure could be related to retail investors getting burned and deciding to turn away from the market altogether. However, Cramer argued that the more important factor at play is how large market participants respond to the meme-stock froth.
“When money managers see this kind of action, they tend to throw up their hands and step aside for a bit because they hate it when stocks can’t be judged on the fundamentals, even if it’s stocks that they don’t really care about,” Cramer said. “In other words, these meme stock spikes make the hedge fund guys feel like the inmates are running the asylum, so they decide to take some profits and maybe go on vacation for a week.”Click here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing
Click here to download Jim Cramer’s Guide to Investing at no cost to help you build long-term wealth and invest smarter.CNBC’s Jim Cramer said he’s not shocked by the Nasdaq
’s plunge on Monday, explaining that last week’s Bed Bath & Beyond
trading frenzy indicated weakness in the index could be on the way.
On Monday’s episode of “Mad Money,” Cramer referred to two warnings he gave CNBC Investing Club members last week about the potential for meme-stock froth to spill over into the broader market, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Those words of caution came initially Wednesday morning and then Friday afternoon. On Wednesday, Cramer trimmed two positions in his Charitable Trust to raise cash, citing the Bed Bath & Beyond fiasco as one reason to make the defensive sales.
“The next time you see one of these meme stocks roaring, I want you to ring the register,” Cramer said Monday. “At this point, the Nasdaq’s already down more than 6% from its highs last week, so, in some ways, it’s too late to sell even as I expect more pain. Better to just buy as we get closer to down 12% where the pain has tended to stop.”
Cramer reached the conclusion by looking at seven periods since January 2021 when a heavily shorted stock, or group of stocks, got bid up by retail traders to levels that were disconnected from underlying fundamentals. The first instance in the data set is the original GameStop
frenzy in late January 2021, and the most recent example centered on the monster two-day move GameStop shares had on May 25 and May 26.CNBC’s Jim Cramer explained Monday why he’s not shocked by the Nasdaq Composite’s plunge to start the trading week.

El S&P 500 subió un 0.23% para terminar el día en 4,283.74, mientras el Nasdaq avanzó un 0.21% a 12,965.34. El Promedio industrial Dow Jones subió un 0.06%, o 18.72 puntos a 33,999.04.
Los movimientos del jueves traen al Dow y el S&P 500 dentro del territorio positivo para la semana, avanzando un 0.7% y un 0.08% respectivamente. El Nasdaq está por abajo un 0.63%. 
Las ganancias comerciales continuaron el jueves con reportes de parte de Kohl’s, Bath & Body Works y BJ’s Wholesale. Los resultados ofrecieron una idea sobre la salud del consumidor. Las acciones de Kohl’s cayeron después de que la empresa cortó su guía, mientras que BJ’s Wholesale avanzó luego de sobrepasar las estimaciones. 
Otros datos publicados el jueves ofrecieron pistas sobre el estado de los mercados de empleo y de vivienda. Los datos de desempleo iniciales cayeron a 250,000 para la semana que terminó el 13 de agosto, mientras las ventas de viviendas existentes cayeron un 6% en julio
Los movimientos del jueves vienen después de que el Dow cayó casi 172 puntos el miércoles — rompiendo una racha de ganancias de cinco días — mientras los comerciantes analizaron los minutos de la reunión de la Reserva Federal de julio.
El banco central permanece comprometido a luchar contra la inflación, pero indicó que aún podía ajustar su paso de endurecimiento basado en las condiciones del mercado. Los inversionistas han tenido la esperanza de que la Reserva Federal podría desacelerar el paso de sus aumentos a las tasas después de que el índice de precios al consumidor de julio fue mejor que esperado.
“Lo que está en el asiento del conductor es la Reserva Federal, y lo que lo impulsa — la gasolina en el tanque de la Reserva Federal — es la inflación,” dijo Cliff Corso, director de inversiones en Advisors Asset Management. ” Creo que el mercado va a rebotar un poco de un lado a otro por el futuro previsible, ahora está en una tendencia positiva, porque el mercado aún se está sumergiendo en la esperanza de que la Reserva Federal está luchando contra la inflación.”

"Dow cierra más de 400 puntos más alto, Nasdaq rompe caída de 7 días consecutivos",EDT-20225:18-PM,"Las acciones subieron el miércoles, tratando de sacudirse una caída de tres semanas, ya que las tasas y los precios del petróleo disminuyeron, enfriando las preocupaciones de los inversores sobre la alta inflación continua.
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones ganó 435.98 puntos, o un 1.40%, para cerrar el día en 31,581.28. El S&P 500 subió un 1.83% hasta los 3,979.87. Mientras que el Nasdaq Composite, enfocado en la tecnología, subió un 2.14% hasta 11,791.90, rompiendo una racha de siete días consecutivos de pérdidas.
Los rendimientos de los bonos del Tesoro de Estados Unidos cayeron tras un salto el martes. Los precios del petróleo se desplomaron, con el crudo West Texas Intermediate a 81.94 dólares el barril, su cierre más bajo desde enero. La libra esterlina alcanzó su nivel más bajo frente al dólar estadounidense desde 1985.
Las acciones repuntaron luego de que la vicepresidenta de la Fed, Lael Brainard, reafirmó que el banco central haría lo necesario para reprimir la inflación, al mismo tiempo que señaló los riesgos de ir demasiado lejos. Muchos inversores decidieron centrarse en este último punto de su discurso.
“En algún momento del ciclo de ajuste, los riesgos se volverán más bilaterales,” dijo Brainard. “La rapidez del ciclo de endurecimiento y su naturaleza global, así como la incertidumbre en torno al ritmo al que los efectos de las condiciones financieras más estrictas se están abriendo paso a través de la demanda agregada, crean riesgos asociados con el endurecimiento excesivo.”
Los movimientos alcistas revirtieron una caída anterior en territorio negativo. Los futuros de las acciones se desplomaron después de que un artículo del Wall Street Journal sugiriera que el compromiso del presidente de la Reserva Federal, Jerome Powell, de reducir la inflación podría significar que el banco central aumente las tasas por 0.75 puntos porcentuales en septiembre, lo que sería el tercer aumento consecutivo de ese tamaño.
El miércoles, la Reserva Federal entregó su resumen sobre las condiciones económicas actuales, conocido como el Libro Beige. El informe mostró que la actividad económica cambió poco en muchas regiones de los Estados Unidos y que las perspectivas de crecimiento continúan débiles.
Las acciones han tenido problemas recientemente debido a que los rendimientos del Tesoro cotizan en torno a sus niveles más altos desde junio. Además, septiembre ha sido históricamente el mes más duro para el mercado. Todos los ojos están puestos en el nivel de 3,900 del S&P 500. Algunos ven que el índice cae a mínimos aún más bajos, mientras que otros son optimistas sobre un repunte de fin de año.
“Con las acciones de vuelta a los mínimos de junio y el camino de las tasas restableciéndose, una mayor disminución de la inflación junto con una intervención decisiva del gobierno de la UE para abordar la crisis energética podría provocar otro apretón bajista”, escribió Emmanuel Cau de Barclays en una nota del miércoles. “En general, creemos que las acciones se mantienen en una situación difícil dada una mala compensación de la política de crecimiento.”

Traducido por Jennifer GarciaLos inversionistas continuaron a moverse hacia los valores de tecnología, que han impulsado el repunte de esta semana, ya que algunos resultados corporativos fuertes tenían a Wall Street en búsqueda de activos debilitados. 
“Lo que estás viendo en el mercado hoy es una continua potencial de recuperación, un poco de una continua potencial de optimismo para números que no sean tan malas como temido, pero eso ha estado pasando en el mercado ahora por casi un mes,” dijo Robert Cantwell, gestor de cartera en Upholdings. 
Las acciones de consumo discrecional lideraron las ganancias en el S&P 500, que aumentó más de un 2% gracias a las acciones de Tesla. Las acciones de Tesla subieron casi un 9.8% después de que el fabricante de automóviles reportó un informe de ganancias más fuerte que esperado, a pesar de disminuir los márgenes de la automoción. Las acciones aún están un 23% por debajo este año.
Mientras tanto, el valor del dólar cayó después de una subida sorpresa de la tasa de interés el jueves de parte del Banco Central Europeo, que subió sus tasas por primera vez en 11 años. El banco central subió sus tasas de referencia por 50 puntos básicos.
Un debilitamiento del dólar podría impulsar las acciones de las empresas de tecnología, ya que muchas empresas grandes reciben una gran parte de sus ganancias fuera de los Estados Unidos.
A pesar de estos movimientos, algunos inversionistas continuaron a señalar los informes de ganancias débiles y otros resultados decepcionantes del segundo trimestre como indicadores que el mercado aún no ha encontrado un fondo. 
“Si las condiciones financieras siguen endureciendo en el camino actual, entonces eso significa que el valor justo macro de la renta variable estadounidense continuará a la baja,” dijo Huw Roberts, jefe de análisis de Quant Insight.

Los declives vinieron después de que el fabricante de chips de memoria Micron advirtió que sus ganancias podrían quedar por debajo de su estimado anterior por causa de “factores macroeconómicos y las limitaciones de la cadena de distribución.” Sus acciones cayeron más de un 3%. 
Ha sido una semana dificil para los fabricantes de los chips. El lunes, una guía de ganancias más baja de lo esperado de Nvidia pesó sobre el grupo, y las acciones extendieron sus pérdidas el martes. 
“Hay dos grandes jugadores que creo que los inversionistas pensaban estaban en una mejor posición para navegar algunos de los recientes problemas en la cadena de distribución. Creo que hay una preocupación de que esto va a pesar mucho sobre la tecnología,” dijo Ed Moya, analista de mercado senior en Oanda. 
El S&P 500 ha subido por tres semanas consecutivas, pero la temporada de ganancias ha presentado advertencias de demanda de parte de los ejecutivos de empresas notables. Los inversionistas están vigilando de cerca para poder determinar cómo la lucha de la Reserva Federal contra la inflación está agitando la economía.”
“Todo lo que estamos recibiendo está (mostrando) que la inflación está teniendo un impacto más duro en las perspectivas de las empresas estadounidenses, y por eso es que creo que en este mercado será difícil continuar a comprar valores,” Moya agregó. 
Aparte de los chips, un par de acciones en Nasdaq también recibieron golpes fuertes. Novavax cayó casi un 30% después de cortar su guía de ganancia de año-completo debido a la baja demanda de sus vacunas del Covid. Upstart declinó más de un 11% después de que la empresa de préstamos al consumidor reportó resultados del segundo trimestre que no alcanzaron llegar a las expectativas de ganancias ni de ingresos. 
Los inversionistas están esperando el informe del índice de precios al consumidor de julio, que se espera el miércoles. El informe está esperado a mostrar una ligera desaceleración en la inflación, gracias en parte a la caída de los precios del combustible, lo que podría informalre al mercado sobre los próximos pasos para la Reserva Federal.

El S&P 500 cayó un 0.12% a 4,140.06. El Nasdaq Composite bajó un 0.1% a 12,644.46. Mientras que el Dow mantuvo una ganancia de 29.07 puntos para cerrar en 32,832.54.

Disney fue la principal acción en el Dow Jones, ganando más del 2%.
Los movimientos del lunes siguieron un alza semanal para el S&P 500 y el Nasdaq Composite, ya que un informe mensual de empleos sorprendentemente sólido alivió algunos temores de recesión. El resistente mercado laboral también indicó que la economía podría soportar más alzas de tasas por parte de la Reserva Federal.
“La pregunta es si el repunte se está quedando sin amplitud,” dijo Angelo Kourkafas, estratega de inversiones de Edward Jones. “Ciertamente hay cosas que han mejorado después del mes pasado que justificarían, en nuestra opinión, un movimiento al alza, que ciertamente hemos visto. ...

"El S&P 500 y el Nasdaq caen el viernes, pero alcanzan ganancias semanales después del extraordinario informe de empleo de julio",EDT-20225:22-PM,"Las acciones fluctuaron el viernes en una sesión volátil después de que el informe de empleo de julio fue mucho más mejor de lo esperado. Los inversionistas evaluaron lo que un mercado laboral fuerte podría significar para la campaña de la Reserva Federal de endurecer las tasas. 
El Promedio Industrial Dow Jones ganó 76.65 puntos, o un 0.23% para terminar en 32,803.47. Aun con estas ganancias del viernes, el índice cayó por la semana. El S&P 500 cayó un 0.16% para terminar en 4,145.19, y el Nasdaq Composite bajó un 0.50% el viernes, llegando a 12,657.56. A pesar de eso, ambos el S&P 500 y el Nasdaq Composite terminaron la primera semana de agosto más altos.
Las pérdidas fueron compensadas por las acciones bancarias, que subieron con la esperanza de que los aumentos a la tasa de interés continúen. Las acciones de energía también tuvieron ganancias, pero las empresas de tecnología descendieron.
El mercado laboral añadió 528,000 empleos en julio, sobrepasando la estimación del Dow Jones de un incremento de 258,000 empleos. La tasa de desempleo bajó a 3.5%, por debajo de la estimación de 3.6%. El crecimiento salarial también incrementó más de lo esperado, subiendo un 0.5% para el mes y estuvo un 5.2% más alto que el año pasado, señalando que la inflación alta probablemente sigue siendo un problema.
Las acciones empezaron la sesión en los mínimos después del informe, a pesar de que parecía indicar que la economía no está actualmente en una recesión. El crecimiento de empleo estaba esperando a reducir mientras la Reserva Federal continúa aumentando las tasa de interés para controlar la inflación, pero este informe muestra que el mercado laboral continúa fuerte. Eso significa que el banco central podría tener que actuar más agresivamente en su próxima reunión.
 “Quien se haya subido en la idea que ‘la Reserva Federal va a girar el próximo año y empezará a cortar las tasas’ va tener que bajarse el la próxima estación, porque eso no está en las cartas,” dijo Art Hogan, jefe de estrategia de mercado en B. Riley Financial. “Es claramente una situación en donde la economía no está parando or yéndose hacia una recesión aquí y ahora.”
El informe es crucial, ya que es una de dos informes que el banco central verá antes de que decida cuánto va a alzar las tasas en su reunión en Septiembre. La Reserva Federal tendrá otro informe de empleo y dos más números de índice de precio al consumidor para evaluar antes de que haga su próxima decisión. 
Los promedios principales tuvieron su mejor mes desde el 2020 en julio con la esperanza de que la Reserva Federal retrasara su paso de sus aumentos. El S&P 500 aumentó un 9.1% el mes pasado.

Nasdaq sube por quinto día consecutivo después de un sólido informe de empleo mientras Wall Street logra una semana ganadora,EDT-20225:28-PM,"Las nóminas no agrícolas aumentaron 372,000 el mes de junio, una cifra mejor que la estimación de 250,000 del Dow Jones y continuando lo que ha sido un año sólido para el crecimiento del empleo, según datos del viernes de la Oficina de Estadísticas Laborales.
Los tres promedios principales terminaron en números verdes la semana. El informe de empleo y una reciente caída en los precios de las materias primas han hecho que el llamado “aterrizaje suave” de la economía estadounidense sea un poco más probable, lo que impulsó las acciones, dijo Yung-Yu Ma, de BMO Wealth Management.
“Algunos de los que eran temores de recesión muy agudos probablemente han retrocedido un poco ... Creo que el mercado comenzó a aceptar eso un poco más como una posibilidad esta semana,” dijo Ma.
Las acciones de atención de la salud se encontraban entre las de mejor rendimiento. Centene Corp. y McKesson subieron más del 3%, mientras que los fabricantes de vacunas Moderna y Regeneron aumentaron cada uno más del 2%.
El fabricante de automóviles eléctricos Tesla saltó un 2.5%. Los fabricantes de chips y las acciones de seguridad cibernética también impulsaron el sector tecnológico. ON Semiconductor subió un 2.8%, mientras que Fortinet ganó casi un 1.8%.
Los rendimientos de los bonos del Tesoro subieron bruscamente después de la publicación de los datos de empleo, lo que puede haber limitado las ganancias de las acciones. El rendimiento del Tesoro a 2 años se mantuvo por encima del rendimiento del Tesoro a 10 años, una inversión que muchos ven como un indicador de recesión.
Aunque el informe de empleo fue una señal positiva, muchos inversores creen que permitirá a la Reserva Federal luchar agresivamente contra la inflación con aumentos de tasas en los próximos meses.
“Las buenas noticias son malas noticias para el mercado actual... no se puede pedir nada mejor de este informe de empleo en términos de amplias ganancias, bajo desempleo, el número superó las expectativas”, dijo Michael Arone de State Street Global Advisors.
“Los salarios estaban creciendo, pero a un ritmo más lento. ... Eso fue algo bueno, y sin embargo, los mercados se encogieron de hombros aquí porque al final, la conclusión es que la Fed va a subir 75 puntos básicos,” Arone agregó.
En la semana, el Nasdaq cerró con una subida del 4.6 %, mientras que el S&P 500 ganó un 1.9%. El Dow Jones quedó rezagado, pero aun así ganó alrededor de un 0.8%.

Phillip Toews, director ejecutivo de Toews Corporation, dijo que el mercado parece estar “al alza” debido a las condiciones de sobreventa, pero que la agresiva Fed evitará que se produzca un repunte mayor en el corto plazo.
“Desafortunadamente, la Reserva Federal realmente tiene un objetivo implícito ahora de mantener bajos los activos financieros, y nos va a costar mucho acostumbrarnos a eso,” dijo Toews. “Esa es una de las cosas más importantes que pueden hacer en este momento para mover el dial de la inflación. ... Habrá un día en el que sea muy positivo sobre el mercado de valores, pero ese día no es hoy.”
Las acciones de materias primas tuvieron un desempeño inferior, continuando la volatilidad reciente de dicho sector. Las acciones mineras de Freeport-McMoRan cayeron casi un 4.2%.
Las acciones de viajes cayeron durante el día, con Caesars Entertainment cayendo casi un 4.7% y Carnival Corp. cayendo un 3.4%.
Twitter cayó más de un 5% y se encontraba entre los de peor desempeño en el S&P 500 luego de que el Washington Post informó que Elon Musk planeaba retirar su oferta de adquisición.

La temporada de ganancias del segundo trimestre comienza la próxima semana con los informes de la mayoría de los principales bancos. El informe del índice de precios al consumidor de junio, programado para el miércoles, también será un punto clave para los inversores.

Jim Cramer says investors should eye these three tech names in the Nasdaq 100,EDT-20227:30-PM,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Tuesday told investors his three stock picks from the worst- and best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 during the first half of this year.
“Tech stocks were horrendous in the first half. … No Apple
s, no Google
s, no semis, no software as services – just default names that show you that tech’s become absolutely hated, maybe so hated that I think we could see a serious bounce,” he said.
“When it comes to tech, FANG went into a portfolio manager-induced coma in the first half and Netflix
was the first to be put under. What else is there to say, except that if any stock has fallen hard enough … then there’s certainly hope for a resuscitation,” he added, referring to his acronym for Facebook-parent Meta
, Amazon
, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.
To illustrate his point, the “Mad Money” host listed the five worst and five best performers in the Nasdaq 100. 
Out of the 10 names, he highlighted two stocks as potential buys.
Here is his list of the top five best performers in the Nasdaq 100:
Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Activision Blizzard
T-Mobile
Constellation Energy
Seagen
Out of these names, Cramer said that he thinks investors should buy shares of Seagen, especially given speculation that Merck could make a bid for the biotech company, according to The Wall Street Journal.
T-Mobile is also a buy, he said, predicting that the company will have a great performance in its next quarter.
Next, Cramer went over the five worst performers in the Nasdaq 100. 
Here is his list:
Netflix
Align Technology
PayPal
DocuSign
Okta
Cramer said that he believes Align is attractive at its current price. “I think it can make a slow and steady comeback,” he said.

A weakening dollar could boost shares of tech companies, as several major companies in the space get a chunk of their revenues from outside of the U.S.
Despite those moves, some investors pointed to weak economic reports and greater inflationary pressures as signs that markets have yet to bottom.
“If overall financial conditions keep tightening on the current path, then that means that macro fair value for US equities will continue to trend lower,” said Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight.The Nasdaq Composite rose Thursday as Tesla shares surged on the back of better-than-expected earnings results. Tech stocks also got a boost from a softer U.S. dollar.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.36% to close at 12,059.61. The S&P 500 added 0.99% to finish at 3,998.95. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 162.06 points, or 0.51%, in a choppy session. The blue-chip index ended at 32,036.90.
The Nasdaq is set for a gain this week, up about 5.3%. Meanwhile, the Dow is nearly 2.4% higher for the week, while the S&P 500 climbed 3.5%.
Investors continued to pivot into tech stocks, which have fueled this week’s rally, as some strong corporate results had Wall Street on the hunt for beaten-down assets.
“What you’re seeing in the market today is continued potential recovery, some continued potential optimism for numbers not being as bad as feared,” said Robert Cantwell, portfolio manager at Upholdings. “But that’s been happening in the market now for almost a month.”
Consumer discretionary stocks led gains in the S&P 500, up more than 2% on the back of Tesla shares. The automaker surged about 9.8% after it reported stronger-than-expected results despite shrinking automotive gross margins. Shares are still down nearly 23% this year."
"El S&P 500 cierra su peor primera mitad desde 1970, y el Nasdaq cae más del 1% para cerrar el trimestre",EDT-20225:44-PM,"El Departamento de Comercio reportó el jueves que el índice de precios de gastos de consumo personal, que es la medida preferida de medir la inflación de la Reserva Federal, subió un 4,7% en mayo. Eso es 0,2 puntos de porcentaje menos que el mes pasado, pero todavía alrededor de los niveles que no se han visto desde los 1980s. El índice estaba esperado a mostrar un aumento de año-a-año de 4.8% en mayo de acuerdo a Dow Jones.
El Chicago PMI, que sigue la actividad de los negocios en la región, llegó a 56, un poco menos de la estimación de StreetAccount de 58.3.
La Reserva Federal ha tomado acción agresiva para tratar de reducir la inflación, que ha surgido a un máximo de 40 años.
La Presidenta de la Reserva Federal de Cleveland, Loretta Mester, le dijo a CNBC que ella apoya un aumento de 75 puntos básicos en la reunión del banco central en julio si las condiciones económicas persisten. A principios de junio, la Reserva Federal aumentó su tipo de referencia de la tasa de interés por tres-quartos de un punto de porcentaje, que fue el mayor aumento desde 1994.
Algunos en Wall Street están preocupados qué acciones muy agresivas podrían llevar la economía hacia una recesión. 
“No creemos que el mercado de valores haya llegado a su fondo todavía, y vemos más bajadas por venir. Los inversionistas deberían de tener niveles elevados de dinero en efectivo ahora mismo,” dijo George Ball, director de Sanders Morris Harris.
Courtney Garcia de Payne Capital Management, dijo que aunque la inflación está aumentando, aún va a estar en efecto por un largo tiempo, pero aún hay muchas buenas oportunidades para los inversores en este ambiente.
“Los mercados van a identificar una recesión antes de que actualmente suceda una recesión, y eso es en lo que te debes de enfocar como un inversor,” ella dijo en “Power Lunch” de CNBC el jueves. “Cuando tienes un periodo como ahora en donde los mercados están por abajo más de un 15% en la primera mitad de año, lo que ha sucedido un par de veces en la historia, suelen tener un buen segundo mitad de año por un promedio de alrededor de 24%.”

El Nasdaq Composite enfocado en la tecnología está en un declive de un 22.4% para el segundo trimestre, su peor periodo desde 2008.
El S&P 500 también cerró con su peor primera mitad de año desde 1970, el cual ha sido dominado por una myriad de factores presionando al mercado. Entre ellos se incluye la inflación, las tarifas aumentadas de la Reserva Federal, la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania, y las cerraduras de Covid-19 en China- todos han ayudado a generar miedo de una recesión global.
“Tuvimos una pandemia inesperada que paralizó el mundo y causó efectos inesperados, tanto monetarios como fiscales,” dijo la directora de inversiones en Homrich Berg, Stephanie Lang, a CNBC. “Creó la tormenta perfecta en desequilibrar las cadenas de demanda y producción, y ahora hay niveles de inflación que no hemos visto en décadas, y la Reserva Federal fue tomada por sorpresa.” Ella añadió que “ahora el mercado está forzado a ajustarse a esta nueva realidad en donde la Reserva Federal está tratando de ponerse al día y detener el crecimiento.” 
El Nasdaq enfocado en la tecnología ha sido especialmente afectado este año. El índice está ahora más de 31% por debajo de su máximo de Nov. 22. Algunas de las empresas más grandes de la tecnología han registrado declines grandes este año, como Netflix que cayó un 71%. Apple y Alphabet han perdido un 23% y un 24.8% respectivamente, mientras Meta ha caído un 52%.

Sin embargo, la compañía dijo que le dio a Musk la información que necesitaba para evaluar los reclamos.
Mientras tanto, el rendimiento del Tesoro a 2 años se mantuvo por encima de su contraparte a 10 años, una inversión que muchos ven como un indicador de recesión. La tasa a 2 años el lunes se cotizó en 3.07%, mientras que la de 10 años se ubicó en 2.99%.
Los movimientos del lunes siguieron a una sesión mixta el viernes en la que el Dow y el S&P 500 cayeron ligeramente, mientras que el Nasdaq Composite subió por quinto día consecutivo. Todos los principales promedios aseguraron una semana ganadora después de que un informe laboral mejor de lo esperado el viernes mostrará que la recesión económica que preocupa a los inversores aún no ha llegado.
El informe de empleo, si bien es bueno para la economía, podría animar a la Reserva Federal a continuar con sus agresivos aumentos de tasas en los próximos meses para combatir la inflación persistentemente alta.
Aun así, algunos creen que se avecinan más golpes para los mercados.
“Estamos en un mercado bajista de acciones, y en un mercado bajista las sorpresas ocurren a la baja y no al alza”, dijo Adam Sarhan, fundador y director ejecutivo de 50 Park Investments. “La tendencia seguirá siendo bajista hasta que veamos máximos y mínimos más altos”.
Los inversores también esperan la publicación del índice de precios al consumidor de junio el miércoles. Se espera que la inflación general, incluyendo los alimentos y la energía, aumenten por encima del nivel de 8.6% de mayo a 8.8%, según estimaciones del Dow Jones.

“Siempre se trata de ganancias,” dijo Tim Lesko de Mariner Wealth Advisors. “La expectativa ha sido durante un año que no se trata de las ganancias finales, se trata de las expectativas económicas futuras. Realmente no ha importado lo que la gente ha informado en forma de ganancias de ingresos. Ha sido la charla que han tenido sobre cómo esperan que se vea su futuro negocio.”"

El Nasdaq, con un fuerte componente tecnológico, superó a los demás promedios mientras los participantes en el mercado continuaron a reflejar sobre la probabilidad de una recesión económica, y mientras el rendimiento del bono del Tesoro a 10 años caía a su nivel más bajo en aproximadamente dos semanas. Los rendimientos se mueven de forma inversa a los precios.
“La acción del mercado que hemos visto hoy y ayer, por lo menos en los aspectos internos, sugiere que el mercado se está preocupando cada vez más con el crecimiento económico mundial,” dijo Scott Ladner, director de inversiones de Horizon Investments. Esto es resaltado por el hecho que las tasas están bajando en el frente de la curva de rendimiento de los Estados Unidos, el agregó.
Un vistazo al índice de mercado más amplio mostró que los valores más defensivos, como los de consumo básico, las empresas de servicios públicos, las inmobiliarias y las de atención médica, impulsaron el rendimiento, con cada sector subiendo un 2%. Los valores de consumo básico, como Clorox, ganaron un 6%.
Los constructores de viviendas ayudaron a impulsar los valores cíclicos de los consumidores, ya que las acciones de Lennar y D.R. Horton subieron el 4.5% y el 5.2%, respectivamente.
Mientras tanto, la energía fue el sector de peor rendimiento en el S&P 500 ya que los precios del petróleo se han visto afectados. Las acciones de Schlumberger cayeron casi 6.8%. Valero Energy cayó un 7.6%, y Phillips 66 cayó casi un 6.8%.
Las acciones de las aerolíneas cayeron por causa de los problemas del transporte. Las acciones de United Airlines cayeron casi 2.5% luego de que la aerolínea cortó los viajes fuera de Newark por un 12%. Las acciones de American Airlines cayeron un 0,9% después de que la compañía dijera que abandonaría el servicio a cuatro ciudades pequeñas de los EE. UU.
El presidente de la Reserva Federal Jerome Powell reiteró el jueves que el banco central está “fuertemente comprometido” a reducir la inflación mientras hablaba de política monetaria por el segundo día frente al Congreso. También noto que una recesión es una “posibilidad,” un temor que ha seguido sopesando sobre Wall Street.
UBS es el último banco de inversión esta semana que ha elevado sus probabilidades de recesión a un 69%. Citigroup y Goldman Sachs también elevaron sus expectativas de una recesión esta semana.
“Ahora estamos al pendiente de cualquier seguimiento negativo adicional, o si simplemente alcancemos lograr un punto alto local y se reanuda cierto impulso de crecimiento en los datos,” dijo UBS en una nota del jueves.
Por otro lado, un estratega de JPMorgan dijo el jueves que cree que la economía estadounidense esquivará por completo la recesión, y que el mercado de valores recuperará las pérdidas en la segunda mitad del año.
Los promedios principales están en camino para una semana positiva, con el Dow subiendo un 2.6%, el S&P 500 ganando un 3.3%, y el Nasdaq Composite subiendo un 4%.
El jueves, el Departamento de Trabajo dijo que las solicitudes semanales de subsidio de desempleo en los Estados Unidos disminuyeron un 2.000, hasta una cifra desestacionalizada de 229.000, en la semana que finalizó el 18 de junio, lo que demuestra que el mercado laboral sigue siendo apretado.

Nasdaq rises for fifth-straight day after strong jobs report as Wall Street notches winning week,EDT-20225:27-PM,"Nonfarm payrolls increased 372,000 in the month of June, better than the 250,000 Dow Jones estimate and continuing what has been a strong year for job growth, according to data Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
All three major averages finished up for the week. The jobs report and a recent decline in commodities prices have made a have made a so-called “soft landing” for the U.S. economy a bit more likely, boosting stocks, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.
“Some of what were very acute recession fears have probably backed off a little bit. ... I think the market started to accept that a little more as a possibility this week,” Ma said.
Health care stocks were among the outperformers. Centene Corp. and McKesson rose more than 3%, while vaccine makers Moderna and Regeneron each added more than 2%.
Electric automaker Tesla jumped 2.5%. Chipmakers and cyber security stocks also boosted the tech sector. ON Semiconductor rose 2.8%, while Fortinet gained 1.8%.
Treasury yields jumped sharply after the jobs data was released, which may have limited gains for stocks. The 2-year Treasury yield held above the 10-year Treasury yield, an inversion that is seen by many as a recession indicator.
Though the jobs report was a positive sign for the state of the U.S., many investors believe that will allow the Federal Reserve to aggressively fight inflation with rate hikes in the coming months.
“Good news is bad news for the market today...you couldn’t ask for anything better from this jobs report in terms of broad gains, low unemployment, the number was above expectations,” said Michael Arone of State Street Global Advisors. “Wages were growing but at a slower rate. …That was a good thing, and yet the markets kind of shrugged their shoulders here because at the end, the conclusion is the Fed is going to go by 75 basis points.”
For the week, the Nasdaq closed up 4.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.9%. The Dow lagged but still gained about 0.8%.
Phillip Toews, the CEO at Toews Corporation, said that the market appears to be “drifting higher” from oversold conditions but that the aggressive Fed will keep a larger rally from happening in the short term.
“Unfortunately, the Fed really implicitly has an objective now of keeping financial assets down, and we’re just going to have a very hard time getting used to that,” Toews said. “That’s one of the biggest things they can do right now to move the dial on inflation. ...There will be a day when I am very positive about the stock market, but that day is not today.”
On Friday, commodities stocks underperformed, continuing recent volatility in those sectors. Mining stock Freeport-McMoRan lost 4.2%.
Travel stocks were down for the day, with Caesars Entertainment falling 4.7% and Carnival Corp. falling 3.4%.
Twitter fell more than 5% and was among the worst performers in the S&P 500 after the Washington Post reported that Elon Musk was planning to back out of his takeover offer.
The second-quarter earnings season begins in earnest next week, with reports due out from most major banks. The June consumer price index report, scheduled for Wednesday, will also be a key focus for investors.

"S&P 500 posts worst first half since 1970, Nasdaq falls more than 1% to end the quarter",EDT-20226:14-PM,"Some Wall Street watchers are worried that too-aggressive action will tip the economy into a recession.
“We do not believe the stock market has bottomed yet and we see further downside ahead. Investors should be holding elevated levels of cash right now,” said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris. “We see the S&P 500 bottoming at around 3,100, as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive, but necessary inflation-fighting measures are likely to depress corporate earnings and push stocks lower.”
Courtney Garcia, senior wealth advisor at Payne Capital Management, said even if inflation is peaking, it’s going to stick around for a while longer but that there are still good opportunities for investors in this environment.
“The markets are going to price in the recession before the recession actually happens and that’s what you need to focus on as an investor,” she told CNBC’s “Power Lunch” Thursday. “When you have a period like now where the markets are down more than 15% in the first half of the year, which has happened a couple times in history, they tend to have a really good second half of the year by an average of about 24%.”
However, Lang said that in this current downturn, the Fed is less likely to step in with easy policy to help limit big losses in equities — which has been known since the days of former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan as “the Fed put” — than it has been in the past.
“Inflation is going to persist for a while, so it’s our expectation that the Fed will stay full steam ahead and you won’t have that Fed put that we’ve seen in every other big sell-off in the last decade plus,” she said.

Goldman Sachs reveals 7 under-the-radar global stocks to buy this year
Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyA surge in bond yields earlier in the year and historically pricey equity valuations sent tech stocks tumbling first, as investors rotated out of growth-oriented areas of the market. Rising rates make future profits, like those promised by growth companies, less attractive.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq has been hit especially hard this year. The index is now more than 31% below its Nov. 22 all-time high. Some of the largest technology companies have registered sizeable declines this year, with Netflix down 71%. Apple and Alphabet have lost roughly 23% and 24.8%, respectively, while Facebook-parent Meta has slid 52%.
On Thursday, Universal Health Services fell 6.1% and helped lead the market lower after it issued second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance below expectations, citing lower patient volumes. Shares of HCA Healthcare lost 4.3%. Abiomed and Viatris were lower by more than 3%.
Pharmacy stock Walgreens Boots Alliance was the biggest decliner in the Dow, down 7.2% after the company reiterated its full-year forecast of adjusted per-share earnings growth in the low single digits.
Cruise stocks continued to drag, after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on Carnival roughly in half Wednesday and said it could potentially go to zero. Carnival shares were down more than 2% Thursday. Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line each fell more than 3%.
Home retail stocks were down, too. High-end furniture chain RH saw shares drop about 10.6% after it issued a profit warning for the full year. Wayfair and Williams-Sonoma fell roughly 9.6% and 4.4%, respectively.
Inflation and the economy
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, rose 4.7% in May, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That’s 0.2 percentage points less than the month before, but still around levels last seen in the 1980s. The index was expected to show a year-over-year increase of 4.8% for May, according to Dow Jones.
The Chicago PMI, which tracks business activity in the region, came in at 56 in June, slightly below a StreetAccount estimate of 58.3.
The Federal Reserve has taken aggressive action to try and bring down rampant inflation, which has surged to a 40-year high.
Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester told CNBC Wednesday that she supports a 75 basis point hike at the central bank’s upcoming July meeting if current economic conditions persist. Earlier in June, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, the largest increase since 1994.Stocks fell on Thursday, as the S&P 500 capped its worst first half in more than 50 years.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 253.88 points, or 0.8%, to 30,775.43. The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.9% to 3,785.38, and the Nasdaq Composite pulled back by 1.3% to 11,028.74.
Thursday marked the final day of the second quarter. The Dow and S&P 500 posted their worst quarter since the first quarter of 2020 when Covid lockdowns sent stocks tumbling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down 22.4% for the second quarter, its worst quarterly performance since 2008.
The S&P 500 posted its worst first half of the year since 1970, hurt by worries about surging inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes, as well as Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine and Covid-19 lockdowns in China.
“We had the unprecedented pandemic that shut the world down and the unprecedented response, both fiscal and monetary,” Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, told CNBC. “It created the perfect storm with regard to surging demand and supply chain disruptions, and now there’s inflation that we haven’t seen in decades and a Fed that was caught off guard.”
“Now the market is forced to adjust to this new reality where the Fed is trying to play catch up and slow growth,” she added."

End of interactive chart.U.S. stocks rose Thursday after an intraday comeback as the three major indexes each snapped two-day losing streaks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 435.05 points, or 1.3%, to close at 33,248.28. The S&P 500 gained 1.8% to 4,176.82. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.7% to 12,316.90.
The three averages are now on pace for a positive week. The Dow is up 0.1%. The S&P 500 inched up 0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5% week to date.
“Bearish sentiment remains overdone, and a lot of the upcoming profit warnings should mostly be already priced in. Stocks should start to eventually push higher this summer as economic activity moderates,” said Edward Moya, senior analyst with OANDA.
The indexes are now solidly off their lows of the year. The Dow is 8.5% higher. The S&P 500 is up 9.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 11.6% from their respective 52-week lows.
Thursday saw another rocky session on Wall Street with the stock averages oscillating between losses and gains. The Dow was down more than 300 points at its lows of the session.
“The market is on pins and needles waiting to find out if inflation will come down and give us some respite from the Fed rate hike regimen. That’s why we have this choppiness. It’s a period of great uncertainty,” Barry Bannister, Stifel chief equity strategist, said."
"S&P 500 loses 1%, Nasdaq breaks 5-day win streak ahead of earnings season",EDT-20225:34-PM,"Monday’s moves followed a mixed session on Friday that saw the Dow and S&P 500 fall slightly, while Nasdaq Composite rose for a fifth straight day. All of the major averages secured a winning week after a stronger-than-expected jobs report Friday showed that the economic downturn worrying investors has not yet arrived and added to positive sentiment.
While good for the economy, the jobs report could embolden the Federal Reserve to continue its aggressive rate hikes in the coming months to fight persistently high inflation.
Still, some believe further pain is ahead for markets.
“We’re in a bear market for stocks, and in a bear market surprises happen to the downside and not the upside,” said Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO at 50 Park Investments. “The trend is still down until we see higher highs and higher lows.”
Investors are also looking ahead to the release of June’s consumer price index on Wednesday. It is expected to show headline inflation, including food and energy, rising above May’s 8.6% level to 8.8%, according to Dow Jones estimates.

The Dow rose for the fifth trading day in a row, adding 516.91 points, or 1.6%, to close at 32,637.19. The S&P 500 climbed about 2% to 4,057.84.

The Dow and S&P 500 are up 4.4% and 4%, respectively, for the week. The Nasdaq is up 3.4%.
“Although this was an expected, and highly talked about potential ‘oversold’ rally, the underpinning for today’s market climb higher, suggests that last week’s doom and gloom about the all-important U.S. consumer may have been overdone, along with the dire recession headlines,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial."

WATCH: Cash is probably the safest place right now, says Barclays’ DeshpandeThe rotation out of tech began in late 2021 as soaring inflation and the threat of rising rates led investors to areas of the economy deemed safer like energy and financial services.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.com“On the timing front, she says she has two periods where the Nasdaq 100 is likely to make an important low. The first period is yesterday and today,” Cramer said. “In other words, today’s rebound might have more staying power than you’d expect.”
“That said, according to Boroden, while these Fibonacci timing cycles are certainly helpful … we only get an actual reversal of the trend about 60% of the times when we see these reversal signals,” he added.
As for pricing, Boroden said there’s the possibility that the index once again reaches its lows from March 14, according to Cramer. Yet she still believes the Nasdaq 100 is in rough shape as its price stays below the 200-day simple moving average and shorter term 50-day moving average, he added.CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Wednesday said the Nasdaq 100 could reach a low this week and give investors a chance to offload some poorly performing stocks, leaning on analysis from technical analyst Carolyn Boroden.
“The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest the Nasdaq 100 could make an important low sometime this week — and maybe it’s already happened. If that’s the case, then the recent” market storminess could be over for the time being, the “Mad Money” host said.
“However, you might not want to get too attached to this move because Boroden says the underlying technical picture … remains ugly. Still, you could get a good chance to unload some tech here in order to raise money to buy other things that might have an easier time in the market going forward,” he added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday climbed 1.01%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.12%. The Nasdaq Composite increased 2.03%.
Boroden uses the Fibonacci strategy to make predictions about the market. A cluster of Fibonacci timing cycles coming due around the same time means a stock or index could be poised to reverse direction, Cramer explained, adding that that’s how she knew the market would bottom in mid-March. 
The Nasdaq 100 has been “almost straight down since that cluster of Fibonacci timing cycles she mentioned in March,” Cramer said. He added that Boroden is keeping an eye on both time and price parameters to find the next market low where investors could trade.CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Wednesday said the Nasdaq 100 could reach a low this week and give investors a chance to offload some poorly performing stocks, leaning on analysis from technical analyst Carolyn Boroden.

Micron Technology cayó alrededor de un 7,2% y Nvidia perdió aproximadamente un 4,5%. Los nombres tecnológicos de mega capitalización, Alphabet y Meta Platforms, matriz de Google, perdieron un 2,6% y un 4,1%, respectivamente.
Apple retrocedió alrededor de un 3,9% luego de una nota de investigación de Morgan Stanley. La firma dijo que la desaceleración del crecimiento de la App Store, o tienda de aplicaciones, podría perjudicar a la compañía a corto plazo.
Las acciones de Tesla cayeron 3,9% luego de que Reuters informara, citando un correo electrónico interno, que el director ejecutivo Elon Musk quiere eliminar el 10% de los puestos de trabajo del fabricante de automóviles. Según el informe de Reuters, Musk también dijo en el correo electrónico que tiene un “muy mal” presentimiento sobre la economía. 
Los comentarios de Musk se produjeron luego de advertencias de otras compañías líderes. El presidente ejecutivo de JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, dijo el miércoles que espera un “huracán” económico en medio de la guerra en Ucrania y el endurecimiento de la Fed. El jueves, Microsoft recortó su guía de ganancias e ingresos para el cuarto trimestre fiscal, citando cambios desfavorables.Los tres índices terminaron en números rojos la semana acortada por las festividades.

Inversionistas analizaron el último informe de empleo que muestra que la contratación en los Estados Unidos se mantuvo elevada en mayo. Las nóminas no agrícolas agregaron 390,000 empleos el mes pasado, informó la Oficina de Estadísticas Laborales el viernes. Economistas esperaban que se agregaran 328,000 empleos, según el Dow Jones.
Las ganancias promedio por hora aumentaron un 0,3% en mayo, según el BLS, un poco menos que la estimación del consenso de 0,4% y en par con el ritmo de abril.
“Las buenas noticias son malas noticias... Nos recuerda que la Fed sigue siendo el factor decisivo, al menos en respecto a la emoción de los inversores”, dijo Mark Hackett, jefe de investigación de inversiones de Nationwide.
Los operadores que venden acciones probablemente reaccionaron al movimiento de las tasas con temores de que la Reserva Federal endurezca la política monetaria. El rendimiento de los bonos del Tesoro a 10 años subió por encima del nivel del 2,9% después del informe.
“Números tan fuertes probablemente revertirán cualquier esperanza de que la Fed considere una pausa en las alzas de tasas después de los aumentos de junio/julio, porque indicaría que el mercado laboral sigue siendo muy ajustado”, dijo Tom Essaye, de The Sevens Report.
La presidenta de la Fed de Cleveland, Loretta Mester, dijo el viernes por la tarde que apoya los aumentos de tasas agresivos en un futuro, ya que no ha visto suficiente evidencia de que la inflación haya alcanzado su punto máximo.
“No quiero declarar la victoria sobre la inflación antes de ver evidencia realmente convincente de que nuestras acciones están comenzando a hacer el trabajo de reducir la demanda con la oferta agregada”, dijo Mester en “The Exchange” de CNBC.”
Los inversionistas temen que los rendimientos más altos puedan desacelerar demasiado la economía y llevarla a una recesión.

Goldman Sachs reveals 7 under-the-radar global stocks to buy this year
Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyA peek into the broader market index showed more defensive stocks such as consumer staples, utilities, real estate and health-care stocks drove outperformance, with each sector up about 2%. Consumer staples stocks such as Clorox gained 6%.
Homebuilders helped buoy consumer cyclicals, as shares of Lennar and D.R. Horton on Thursday both climbed 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively.
Meanwhile, energy was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 as oil prices took a hit. Shares of Schlumberger dropped nearly 6.8%. Valero Energy fell 7.6% and Phillips 66 declined about 6.8%.
Airline stocks slumped on transportation issues. Shares of United Airlines dropped about 2.5% as it cut back on flights out of Newark by 12%. Shares of American Airlines dipped 0.9% after dropping service to four small U.S. cities.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday reiterated that the central bank is “strongly committed” to bringing down inflation, as he spoke on monetary policy for a second day before Congress. He also noted that a recession is a “possibility,” a fear that has continued to weigh on Wall Street.
“Definitively, we are going into a recession. How severe that recession is yet to be seen,” said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management.Stocks climbed in a late-day rally as bond yields slipped, and Wall Street continued to weigh recession risks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 194.23 points, or 0.64%, to 30,677.36. The S&P 500 gained 0.95% to 3,795.73. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.62% to 11,232.19.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq outpaced the other averages as market participants continued to mull over the likelihood of an economic downturn, and as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to its lowest level in roughly two weeks. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
“The market action that we’ve seen today and yesterday at least on the internals suggests that the market is becoming increasingly concerned with the global economic growth,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. This is highlighted by the fact that rates are going down on the front end of the U.S. yield curve, he added."
"S&P 500 falls, Snap warning drags tech as Nasdaq loses 2%",EDT-20225:54-PM,"The Nasdaq Composite fell on Tuesday as fears from Snap’s bleak warning spread to other tech names, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied into the close from its lows of the day.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped about 2.4% to 11,264.45. The S&P 500 moved 0.8% lower to 3,941.48. Meanwhile, the Dow added 48.4 points, or 0.2%, to 31,928.62. It fell as much as 1.6% earlier in the session.
The blue-chip stock index got a boost from UnitedHealth Group, which jumped 1.1% ahead of the close. Dow components McDonald’s, Verizon and IBM all added more than 2%.
The 10-year Treasury yield made a sudden move lower as investors fearing a recession crowded into bonds sending their prices higher. The 10-year Treasury yield slipped as low as about 2.73% on Tuesday after topping 3% earlier this year.
Shares of tech companies led the day’s losses as investors feared a slowdown in digital advertising following a warning from social media company Snap. Its shares plummeted 43% after the company said it’s bracing to miss earnings and revenue targets in the current quarter and warned of a downturn in hiring. Meta Platforms followed Snap lower, falling 7.6%. Google-parent Alphabet dropped nearly 5% and hit a new 52-week low.
“The main culprit is the Snap warning from Monday evening,” wrote Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge, in a note. “Some are a bit incredulous that a relatively small and perennially unprofitable ephemeral social media firm can take down the whole tape, but given how sensitive this tape is, SNAP is able to punch above its weight.”
“Tech still dominates the market, both numerically (it remains the biggest weighting) and psychologically, and despite aggressive liquidation in the last couple of months, people still own a lot of it,” he added.
Amazon also fell to a new 52-week low, and shares ended the day down 3.2%. Apple shed 1.9%.
“We expect all online ad platforms to feel some impact of a significant consumer pullback,” wrote Morgan Stanley analysts after the Snap warning. “Advertising is cyclical.”
The negative reversal Tuesday came after stocks rallied Monday as the Dow jumped 618 points, or nearly 2%. The S&P 500 rose 1.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%. The brief bounce came as the market is mired in a relentless sell-off with the Dow down for 8 straight weeks and the S&P 500 briefly hitting bear market territory on Friday.
Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said in a slew of tweets Tuesday that with inflation spiraling out of control, aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are the only way to tame it and that investors will ultimately favor those measures to avoid “economic collapse and demand destruction.”
“If the Fed doesn’t do its job, the market will do the Fed’s job, and that is what is happening now,” Ackman said. “The only way to stop today’s raging inflation is with aggressive monetary tightening or with a collapse in the economy.”
The S&P 500 sits 18.2% from its record after falling more than 20% from its high at one point on Friday. The Dow’s losing streak is its longest since 1923.
Along with tech stocks, the sell-off has been driven by losses in the retail sector following weak earnings and outlooks from Target and Walmart last week. Investors got more poor news from that industry Tuesday with Abercrombie & Fitch dropping 28.6% after reporting that freight and product costs weighed on sales for the fiscal first quarter.
Best Buy shares ended the day up 1.2% after the company reported a mixed quarter."
"Dow rallies 400 points as Powell hints Fed could slow pace of rate hikes, Nasdaq jumps 4%",EDT-20225:51-PM,"Alphabet shares rose about 7.7% after the tech giant’s quarterly report showed strong revenue from Google’s search business. Microsoft gained close to 6.7% after reporting a 40% jump in revenue growth for Azure and cloud services. The gains came even after both companies posted earnings and revenue that fell below analyst estimates.
Meta Platforms shares rose nearly 6.6%, ahead of its earnings scheduled for after the bell. Amazon advanced more than 5% after getting hit by the retail carnage Tuesday. Apple added 3.4%.
Retailers rallied too as inflation concerns softened Wednesday afternoon. Walmart, which led retail declines in the previous session, climbed about 3.8%. Kohl’s, Ross Stores and Costco added more than 2% each. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF advanced roughly 2.6%.
Enphase Energy also popped on the back of its latest results, ending the day about 17.9% higher. Chipotle added 14.7% following its mixed second-quarter earnings release.

Investors were also encouraged after Powell noted that he doesn’t believe the economy is currently in a recession. The second-quarter GDP reading is due on Thursday.
Investors have continued to worry that the central bank’s ongoing efforts to lower inflation will push the economy into a recession, or that we may already be in one. Those fears eased Wednesday after Powell said he does not think the U.S. is currently in a recession, adding that “there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well.”
“The reason this is providing some relief to the equity market is the Fed is acknowledging that there can be an impact on growth to the economy based on their policy,” said Gargi Chaudhuri, head of BlackRock’s iShares investment strategy for the Americas. “They’re recognizing there are two sides of this: there’s a growth tradeoff to fight inflation. That recognition is something we had today that we didn’t hear before.”
Many regard two consecutive quarters of negative GDP readings as a recession, but the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, uses multiple other factors to determine one. The GDP reading Thursday is expected to show barely an expansion after first-quarter GDP declined by 1.6%.
Stocks started the day on a high note after getting a boost from tech earnings. Tech stocks added to those gains as the overall market rallied.Loading chart...Stocks rallied Wednesday after the Federal Reserve announced its much anticipated 0.75 percentage point rate increase to fight inflation, but hinted that it could slow the pace of its hiking campaign at some point.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 436.05 points, or nearly 1.4%, to 32,197.59. The S&P 500 gained 2.62% to close at 4,023.61. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 4.06% to 12,032.42. Tech shares led gains a day after quarterly results from Alphabet and Microsoft.
Stocks hit their highs of the session in the afternoon as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell left the door open about the size of the central bank’s rate move at its next meeting in September and noted it would eventually slow the magnitude of rate hikes. Powell said in a press conference that the Fed could hike by 0.75 percentage point again in September, but that it would be dependent on the data."

The strength in Big Tech stocks in recent years “is likely to burst when fundamentals start to meaningfully deteriorate as the overall economy slows,” Wolfe Research’s Chris Senyek said in a research note.
Worries about the global economy loomed. Investors are worried about a Covid surge in China. Regarding the war in Ukraine, a top Russian official said the threat of nuclear war is real. Plus, high inflation in the U.S. is denting demand for goods from houses to sneakers.
“There are a lot of economic growth concerns,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “China is a big customer for U.S. tech. ... The semiconductor industry does a lot of business there. But it’s also concerns with growth here as well.”
Tesla, which has a factory in Shanghai and counts China as a major market for its electric vehicles, was the biggest laggard on the Nasdaq Composite, closing down about 12.2%. The shares also came under pressure as its CEO and founder, Elon Musk, looked to close his proposed deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion.
Chip stocks were among the top decliners on the Nasdaq Composite. Nvidia lost 5.6%, and AMD retreated 6.1%.
Cyclical names tied to economic growth also suffered Tuesday. Dow component 3M fell about 3% despite better-than-expected earnings as the company noted macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges ahead. UPS shares also slid nearly 3.5% despite the shipper’s quarterly earnings and revenue topping expectations.
Other industrial names like General Electric and Boeing were lower Tuesday. GE fell 10.3%, while Boeing eased 5%. GE warned that its 2022 outlook was “trending toward the low end of the range.”
Bank stocks also struggled as interest rates fell. U.S. Treasury yields declined, with the benchmark 10-year rate falling below 2.8%. Wells Fargo dipped 2.7%, and Bank of America lost nearly 2.3%.Citi’s Chronert says a recession is near; shares his ‘top conviction calls’ to tough it out

— CNBC’s Yun Li contributed reportingApril’s consumer price index showed an 8.3% jump, higher than the 8.1% increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The price surge remained near the 40-year high pace of 8.5% seen in March.
Core CPI, which does not include food and energy prices, gained 6.2% compared to expectations of 6%. On a monthly basis, headline CPI rose by 0.3% and core rose 0.6%. It signaled that inflation may be peaking but price pressures will likely persist.
Not all analysts are convinced the data suggests inflation has reached a peak.
“With the annual rate ticking down from 8.5% to 8.3%, it can be tempting to say we’ve seen the peak, but we’ve also been head-faked before as was the case last August,” said Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride
Some analysts see the data as a sign that the Fed is behind the curve in curbing inflation, which could put pressure on the central bank to act more aggressively in tightening monetary policy.
Meanwhile, rising prices have been front-of-mind, particularly as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates and trims its balance sheet to address inflation.
Following the data release, the 10-year Treasury yield
briefly jumped back above the 3% mark but traded down and settled at 2.93%.
The initial negative market reaction to the inflation print was “totally understandable,” but as prices continue to rise, the U.S. is on the brink of a “cost of living crisis,” Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.”
“It’s just a matter of time until we talk about a cost of living crisis and this is what it is,” he said. “Everybody is focusing on the headline number, that’s understandable but look at the core, 6.2%, and look at the composition of inflation that suggests there are many drivers now. This is no longer an issue about just the Ukraine war, this is a broad-based inflation process that the Fed has fallen behind in a major way.”Citi’s Chronert says a recession is near; shares his ‘top conviction calls’ to tough it out

“Everyone wants energy and food and labor costs to all come down, but at the same time, our mechanism for doing that is to increase interest rates,” said Aviva Investors’ Susan Schmidt. “You’re working at countermeasures and it’s worrisome for investors because they’re trying to figure out how this impacts business overall and that’s why I think you’ve seen such whipsaw action in the major indices.”

U.S. gross domestic product unexpectedly declined in the first quarter by 1.4% from the year prior, compared with the 1% growth expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones.
Some investors brushed off the economic contraction, citing the jump in prices and trade deficit as contributing the most to the decline.
“Bottom line, blame the record high trade deficit for the contraction in real GDP, along with an 8% price deflator,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in a note.Loading chart...A slew of corporate earnings reports drove market sentiment Thursday, appearing to be a green light for investors to pick up beaten-down names.
“It’s been a pretty good earnings season and that is supportive for the equity market,” Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, said.
Shares of Meta surged 17.5% following a beat on earnings, a sign that investors may see signs of relief in the beaten-up tech sector. Shares were down 48% on the year heading into the results.
Qualcomm gained 9.7% on the back of strong earnings, while PayPal rose roughly 11.5% despite issuing weak guidance for the second quarter.
Merck shares rose 4.9% and led gainers on the Dow after an earnings beat. McDonald’s, Eli Lilly and Southwest all closed higher Thursday after their quarterly reports.
Apple and Amazon both rose more than 4% ahead of reporting earnings after the bell.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 3.1% to 12,871.53. The S&P 500 gained 2.5% to 4,287.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 614.46 points, or 1.9%, at 33,916.39.
Investors have weathered volatile trading sessions this week as stocks struggle for direction. The major averages staged a big intraday rally to close higher Monday, but stocks dropped Tuesday, leading to the Nasdaq’s worst day since 2020. Stocks attempted to rebound Wednesday, but pared gains late in the session with the Nasdaq closing flat at its low of 2022.
“We’ve been in a significant sell-off here, so sometimes you get these counter-trend moves,” Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said.
Despite Thursday’s rally, the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for its worst month since March 2020, down 9.5%. The S&P 500 is down nearly 5.4% and the Dow is off by 2.2% in April, ahead of the last trading day of the month."

It also scared investors away from buying other technology stocks ahead of earnings. Tesla, which is scheduled to report earnings after the bell, fell 5%. Amazon and Salesforce each lost more than 2%.
On the flipside, Procter & Gamble gained 2.7% and helped lift the Dow after reporting better-than-expected results and hiking its full-year revenue guidance. IBM, another Dow component, rose more than 7.1% following a beat on earnings and revenue.
“Companies so far are highlighting strong demand across industry, despite inflation and supply chain pressures,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. “While we expect this year to continue to be volatile, earnings strength and bearish sentiment is a really nice backdrop for a near-term pop.”
Roughly 12% of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings thus far, with 80% of those names beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. But the real story that’s behind the market’s tepid reaction during earnings so far is the lack of corporate guidance.
Beyond company earnings, investors were also keeping a close eye on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which retreated Wednesday after touching 2.94%, its highest level since late 2018, on Tuesday.
“There seems to be some fatigue around rate hike and inflation discussion,” said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs. “The market has likely priced in the future of rate hikes, inflation is likely nearing a peak and I think there is some positive sentiment around earnings season.”Loading chart...It was a divided market on Wednesday as traders evaluated a rush of first-quarter results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on the back of strong earnings from Procter & Gamble, while the Nasdaq Composite was dragged down by an epic plunge in shares of one-time darling Netflix.
The 30-stock Dow was up 249.59 points, or 0.7%, to 35,160.79. The S&P 500 was essentially flat at 4,459.45. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2% to 13,453.07.

“That means we need three days of successively lower lows, with lower closes, before the downside is truly exhausted,” Cramer said. “In other words, DeMark’s expecting one last leg lower before the weakness in tech runs out of steam.”

The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 2.79% on Monday, levels not seen since January 2019, as the Federal Reserve braces investors for tighter monetary policy ahead.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.18% to 13,411.96, with losses growing deeper in the final hour of trading as growth stocks take the biggest hit from higher rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 413.04 points, or 1.19%, to 34,308.08. The S&P 500 slipped 1.69% to 4,412.53.
After a rough start to the year that saw the Nasdaq fall into correction territory at one point, it rebounded in March with a 3.4% gain. But the selling in growth and tech names has returned in April with the Nasdaq off by more than 5% so far this month. The index is down 17% from its all-time high.
“If we were to stack up what’s moving the markets today, I think we’re just mirroring what we’re seeing in the Treasury yield environment,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “And it’s hard to know what’s going to break that cycle except for a couple of days/weeks where rates either stabilize or are starting to pull back a bit.”"
Nasdaq is poised to underperform S&P 500 for first time since 2016 as investors shun tech stocks,EST-202110:55-AM,"“Zillow is just a classic misstep,” Dollarhide said. “Getting into and flipping houses — that’s a terrible idea. We bought on that dip. It’s an overreaction to the downside. They lost their way, frankly.” For investors like Dollarhide, DocuSign, Zillow and even Zoom make for individual buying opportunities.
To be sure, the performance difference between the two indexes isn’t as notable as it used to be, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 starting to look more alike.
The seven companies with the heftiest weightings in the S&P 500 — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla
, Meta and Nvidia
— now make up about 27% of the index. They’re also the bulkiest members of the Nasdaq, which is the main reason why the two indexes’ growth this year are separated by only a few percentage points.
“The market is becoming increasingly FAANG,” said Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, referring to Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix
and Google.
Lee, speaking on CNBC’s “Halftime Report” on Monday, said he views FAANG as more than just those companies, and includes other tech leaders with large market share and pricing power. While he’s concerned about the impact of inflation and rates on the overall market, Lee said FAANG stocks are his second favorite pick, behind energy, heading into 2022.
“If there’s panic around inflation and Fed tightening, the rest of the market takes it on the chin pretty hard,” Lee said. “I think FAANG is pretty solid in the first half and everything else looks really shaky.”
WATCH: Here’s why Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sees a pullback coming in 2022Dollarhide said he’s used the recent pullback to buy shares of some companies that he sees as well positioned for the future even if they’ve fallen out of favor of late. DocuSign
, for example, is down 30% this year after more than tripling in 2020. Dollarhide said his firm, through its relationship with Charles Schwab
, is constantly using DocuSign, because Schwab “eliminated faxes, paper forms, and it’s the only way you can open a new account these days.”
“I’m using DocuSign five, six, seven times a day, where as I was doing faxes or mailings five, six, seven times a day,” he said.
Another purchase he made was Zillow
, which has plunged over 50% this year, mostly because of the company’s failed effort to crack the home-flipping market. The company exited the business in November after racking up a loss of over $328 million in the latest quarter.Within the S&P 500, the top-performing subgroup of the year was energy, reflecting soaring gas prices. Next came real estate, which delivers high dividends and has benefited from surging demand for warehouse space and residential properties.
Tech isn’t too far behind, mostly because mega-cap companies Apple
and Microsoft
have held up well and make up so much of the tech subgroup, and the overall S&P 500. Alphabet
and Meta Platforms
(formerly Facebook) are part of the communication services sub-index and Amazon is in the consumer discretionary group. Both have slightly underperformed the broader index.
The main problem for the Nasdaq has been the plunging value of companies that picked up huge market caps in 2020, only to see investors turn against them this year.
Zoom
stock has dropped 45% this year, after last year’s 326% increase in revenue led to a quintupling in its stock price. Peloton
, meanwhile, has plummeted 76% after revenue growth peaked at 232% in mid-2020, pushing the stock up over 430% for the year.
Twilio
, Spotify
and Block
(formerly Square) have each fallen more than 20% this year and PayPal
is down 18%. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF, a basket of publicly traded cloud software companies, is about flat for the year after more than doubling in 2020.
“I pointed out to clients, if you’re heavy tech, you’re likely to underperform the overall market,” said Dollarhide. “But keep in mind how much you’ve overperformed the market the last three to four years,”
In 2020, the Nasdaq climbed 44%, while the S&P 500 rose just 16%. From the end of 2016 to the close of 2020, the Nasdaq won every year, rising a total of 139% compared to the S&P 500′s 68% increase.The Nasdaq started 2021 strong, picking up where it left off in 2020, almost doubling up the S&P 500′s gains by mid-February. Then trading tailed off with the arrival of the first Covid-19 vaccines, which raised hopes among investors that the U.S. was on the verge of getting through the pandemic, potentially lessening demand for remote work technology, home workout systems, food delivery apps and tech-based living room entertainment.
Next, inflation reared its head, topping 4% in April, then as high as 6.8% in November. The Federal Reserve initially expected rising prices to be transitory, but they persisted, spurring the central bank to take a more engaged stance, citing expectations for rate hikes in 2022.
That’s created a double whammy for high-multiple tech stocks. Investors are worried about the demand side of some of their businesses, and they’re also rotating into sectors of the market that tend to hold up better in a rising rate environment.
“All the stay-at-home, play-at-home, work-from-home stocks were DOA in 2021, like the pandemic didn’t exist anymore,” said Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Okla. “The last five years, every time it looked like there would be a rotation out of tech, everybody bought the dip — 2021 will go down as the year that investors did not buy the dip in tech.”For the first time in five years, tech investors aren’t the life of the Wall Street party.
As 2021 winds down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 23% for the year, trailing the S&P 500, which has climbed 28%, through Monday. The last two times the S&P 500 topped the Nasdaq occurred in 2016 and 2011.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 103.61 points, or 0.3%, higher to close at 34,921.88 and the S&P 500 gained 0.81% to 4,582.64 with both benchmarks gaining for a second session in a row.
But the Nasdaq Composite was the big outperformer, advancing 1.9% to 14,532.55. The tech-heavy index was once in bear market territory earlier in the year but has clawed its way back to be down just about 10% from its previous record.
Tech shares, which were among the hardest-hit sectors in the first quarter, rose on Monday after one social media stock got a major endorsement from a notable entrepreneur and investor in Elon Musk.
Twitter
shares surged more than 27% following news that Musk purchased a 9.2% passive stake in the company. It was the biggest pop in Twitter’s history since its IPO as investors speculated Musk’s move could lead to a buyout or other major changes, even if the stake is passive.
Musk’s main stock also had a big day with Tesla
shares gaining 5.6% on the back of its latest quarterly electric vehicle delivery figures on Saturday, which came in above the year-earlier period.
Technology companies including Apple
, Amazon
, Alphabet
and Nvidia
were also up more than 2%. U.S.-listed Chinese tech stocks, including Alibaba
and JD.com
, also rallied.
“Again, because tech really took it on the chin in the first quarter, it ends up being sort of a relief rally for tech at this point, as well as for the other growth-oriented sectors,” said Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist. “The Nasdaq is obviously leading the way ... really because there’s not a lot of new news to put additional pressure on the Nasdaq.”
Investors shook off some lingering concerns as they bought tech shares. A key section of the yield curve remained inverted after the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields
shifted for the first time since 2019 Thursday evening. The 5-year note yield is also trading above its 30-year counterpart.
“It likely means that the shot clock to a potential recession has started,” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial. “The good news, historically it can take upwards of a couple of years potentially for a recession to actually take hold.”
Meanwhile, oil also moved higher with WTI crude jumping more than 4% and back above $100 a barrel, while Brent crude rose about 3%, further raising investor concerns about a possible recession.
Oil’s gains came as investors continue to monitor developments in Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that Western nations will impose additional sanctions on Russia in the coming days.
“Equity and bond markets continued to send conflicting signals about the economic outlook,” UBS said in a recent note to clients. “We caution against over-interpreting either signal. Yield curve inversions have historically predicted recessions with a long and uncertain lag, while hopes over cease-fire talks have ebbed and flowed,” the firm added."

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyU.S. stocks staged a late comeback on Monday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hitting new lows for the year before closing up for the day.
The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.63% to 12,536.02, while the S&P 500 rose 0.57% to 4,155.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 84.29 points, or 0.26%, to close at 33,061.50. The Dow was down more than 500 points at its session lows.
The wild trading session came on the heels of a rough April for stocks. The Dow and S&P 500 are coming off their worst month since March 2020, when the pandemic took hold. The Nasdaq had its worst month since 2008.
David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors, said on CNBC’s “The Exchange” that the market has been overly worried about an economic slowdown and investors should step in to buy the dip in stocks.
“You’re able to buy a lot of great businesses at very attractive prices. Historically, that’s been a very good time to put money to work,” Katz said.
Other market strategists, however, warned of a possible short-lived relief rally and pointed to the fresh lows as a sign that stocks still had further to fall.
“Sentiment is negative, but we still didn’t see a flush. We almost needed to see at least a break of these lows to see some more fear in the market, more stop levels triggered,” said Keith Lerner, co-CIO at Truist Advisory Services.
“In some ways, as much as most technicians want to see support held, in my view you almost need to see that [break] to get a more durable bottom.”
Tech was a particular weak point in April, but the group led the rebound on Monday. Netflix and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms jumped about 4.8% and 5.3%, respectively. Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet advanced more than 2% each."

Goldman Sachs reveals 7 under-the-radar global stocks to buy this year
Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyStocks were split in volatile trading on Monday as investors monitored developments in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including a new batch of sanctions from the U.S. and its allies.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 166.15 points, or about 0.49%, but closed well off session lows at 33,892.60. The S&P 500 closed down 0.24% at 4,373.94, while the Nasdaq rallied late in the session for a gain of 0.41% to 13,751.40.
Monday’s moves capped off a rough February for stocks, with the major averages all posting sharp monthly losses.
The volatile session came amid turmoil over the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have held key cities including the capital of Kyiv. Officials from both countries held a round of negotiations near the Belarus border on Monday.
“War is fundamentally a ‘risk off’ environment for risky assets as global investors move into sovereign bonds and other ‘safe havens’ until some kind of conclusion/new normal becomes priced in. ... Everything about this is unprecedented, so about the only rational thing to say about equities is to expect volatility to continue pending a resolution,” Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt said in a note.
Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman rose 6.7% and 7.9%, respectively. Cybersecurity stocks also outperformed, with Crowdstrike jumping 7.4%, helping limit losses for the Nasdaq.
Bank stocks were under pressure, with JPMorgan falling 4.2% and Citigroup dropping 4.4%.
Government bond yields were sharply lower across the curve, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently at 1.83%, off 15 basis points on the session. A basis point is 0.01%; yields move opposite prices and were lower amid high demand for safe-haven bonds.
The lower bond yields may have helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperform, as growth-oriented stocks tend to perform better when rates are low. Shares of Tesla rose 7.5% on Monday.
Currency markets were a major area of volatility on Monday. The Central Bank of Russia more than doubled its key interest rate, to 20% from 9.5% in reaction to a currency move that saw the ruble tumble nearly 22% against the U.S. dollar. The ruble hit a record low against the dollar early Monday.
Over the weekend, the U.S. joined allies in Europe and Canada in moving to bar key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system, SWIFT. The system connects more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories.
Additionally, the U.S. and European allies have also taken action against Russia’s central bank, effectively freezing the country’s foreign reserves.
The sanctions in financial markets had some investors and traders looking for potential disruptions outside of Russian markets.
“Some Russian banks being removed from SWIFT (energy transactions exempt) and the freezing of the Russian central bank’s access to its foreign currency reserves held in the West clearly increases economic tail risk,” said Dennis DeBusschere of 22V Research.
However, DeBusschere pointed out that Russia can still sell oil and said there could be “loop holes” in Russia’s frozen assets, which “might limit the disaster in markets for a few days.”
Meanwhile, Russian military vehicles entered Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv with reports of fighting taking place and residents being warned to stay in shelters. Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert Sunday amid a growing global backlash against the invasion.
Monday marks the final day of trading for February and, even with a strong rally at the end of last week, the three major U.S. averages all fell more than 3% for the month. The Dow was the worst performer, falling 3.5% for its worst month since November.
Stocks, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq, were already in a downturn before the invasion of Ukraine.
The conflict comes “on top of our base case, which is that we were already potentially headed for a bear market due to valuations, rising rates and inflation and the lack of a Fed put,” said Phillip Toews, CEO of Toews Asset Management.
“Now is not a great outlook for the markets, despite some short-term rallies like we saw last week,” Toews added."
"S&P 500 rises to end best week of the year so far, Amazon pushes Nasdaq 1.6% higher on Friday",EST-20224:56-PM,"The Nasdaq Composite, which is tilted towards tech shares, fell 3.7% on Thursday for its worst daily performance since September 2020. The S&P 500 had its worst day in nearly a year, sliding 2.4%, and the Dow fell 518.17 points.
The sharp drop in Meta Platforms, as well as that of Netflix after its earnings last month, could signal weakness under the surface and have bearish implications for the market, according to Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.
“Some of the megacap tech stocks are trading almost like penny stocks. That is a massive shift under the surface from an overtly bullish market, to a market that could be topping and or the beginning of a bearish phase on Wall Street,” he said.

Retail investors are buying the January dip in force, especially these four stocks
The struggles now for Facebook are similar to 2018, so analysts think the stock should bounce backThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite jumped Friday to finish their best week of the year, as continued strength in earnings reports extended the tech-led rebound from the January rout.
The broad market index rose 0.5% to 4,500.53, while the and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.6% to 14,098.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched lower by 21.42 points, or 0.06%, to 35,089.74.
For the week, the S&P 500 1.5% higher, and the Nasdaq rose 2.4%. The Dow ended the week up 1.1%. These gains mark the second weekly advances of 2022 for the major averages — which were under pressure last month as worries of higher interest rates dragged down tech names.
Amazon led the S&P’s and Nasdaq’s gains, as it jumped 13.5% on strong quarterly earnings and cloud revenue beats. Friday’s surge was also Amazon’s biggest one-day gain since 2015. Snap rocketed up 58.8%, the day after reporting earnings. Pinterest rose 11.2%.
“We’re in for a choppy period but tech has been picked on for quite some time, and now, a lot of traders are saying this is the time to be constructive, especially on some of these companies that have proven time and again that they’ve been able to manage different types of environments and are providing optimistic outlooks going forward,” like Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
Traders on Friday also weighed a much stronger-than-expected jobs report and its potential impact on U.S. monetary policy going forward.
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 1.9%, hitting its highest level since December 2019, after the January jobs report showed a 467,000 gain in payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected a minor gain of 150,000, and some economists predicted a large decrease. Economists had cautioned before the report that it could be noisy because of an omicron wave hitting while the survey was taking place.
“For markets, the jobs report is all about the Fed, and today’s upside surprises in both job creation and wage growth keep the Fed on track to begin raising rates in March and hike four or more times this year,” said Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial.
The benchmark yield has jumped from 1.51% at the end of 2021, as the Federal Reserve pivoted to more aggressively fight inflation, signaling it would slow down its bond buying and raise rates several times this year. Higher rates have weighed on stocks, especially tech shares with high valuations. The S&P 500 is down more than 5% this year.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comWhile Cramer said Boroden believes the tech rebound “could have legs,” it’s not entirely clear how long they will last. After all, he noted, tech’s late December strength lasted for about a week and a half before giving way to the early 2022 weakness.
Additionally, Boroden sees at least two bearish technical indicators that suggest it may be difficult for the index to enter a sustained upside move to new highs, Cramer said.
The first is that the Nasdaq 100 remains below its 50-day moving average, Cramer said, calling that a “kiss of death for most chartists.” He added, “There are a lot of money managers out there who follow these charts, even if they won’t always admit it.”The Nasdaq 100
still faces an uncertain near-term outlook despite its intraday turnaround Monday and additional gains Tuesday, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said, leaning on technical analysis from Carolyn Boroden.
“The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 really was due for a bounce this week and that bounce could continue,” the “Mad Money” host said. However, Cramer said to be careful because Boroden believes “the overall technical picture remains ugly.”
Cramer said Boroden identified a potential bounce this week for the Nasdaq 100 through Fibonacci ratios, which she and other market technicians use to identify timing cycles that shed light on when a security may change direction. The root of the Fibonacci strategy is a numerical sequence identified in the 13th century by Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician.  “The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 really was due for a bounce this week and that bounce could continue,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Tuesday.
However, Cramer said to be careful because Boroden believes “the overall technical picture remains ugly.”"
"Nasdaq tumbles 2% Friday, notches worst week since 2020 and falls deeper into correction territory",EST-20224:54-PM,"“Given the emotional decline in the stock market of the last few days, fundamentals have been suspended as market action is entirely tied to technical support levels,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group.
“Until a level is reached in this collapse... fundamentals like bond yields, economic reports and even earnings releases will not likely have much impact. Fear now must be extinguished by some stock market stability before traders and investors again start to consider fundamental drivers,” added Paulsen.
The Nasdaq Composite’s struggle is largely due to a surge in government bond rates this week. The U.S. 10-year Treasury hit as high as 1.9% on Wednesday as investors focused on the Federal Reserve’s timeline for raising interest rates and broadly tightening monetary policy. However, bond yields retreated on Friday.
Investors will now be turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s January two-day policy meeting, set to start on Tuesday.
“While a handful of rate hikes over the next year or two would represent a shift in Fed policy, we wouldn’t consider policy restrictive and we don’t expect the initial rate increase to derail the economic recovery,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. However, he added that rate hikes will inject volatility into the market.
Friday’s selling intensified into the close, continuing a troubling pattern to start the year. The S&P 500, on average, has fallen 0.16 percentage points in the final hour of trading in January, according to Bespoke Investment Group analysis through Wednesday. That average last-hour performance places January in the bottom 1% of all months and third-worst since 2000, Bespoke found.
Small caps have also been hit hard this week. The Russell 2000 secured its worst week since June 2020. The index fell 1.8% on Friday.
Bitcoin was also hit hard on Friday as investors brace for the Fed and dump riskier assets with higher rates ahead. The digital asset fell more than 10% to around $38,233 on Friday.
- CNBC’s Nate Rattner and Patti Domm contributed reporting.U.S. stocks tumbled on Friday, closing out a losing week and continuing a rough start to 2022. The Nasdaq Composite was hit the hardest with Friday’s selling sending the tech-heavy index to its worst week since 2020.
The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.7% to 13,768.92 on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 450.02 points to 34,265.37. The S&P 500 slid 1.9% to 4,397.94.
The Nasdaq posted a 7.6% loss for the week, its worst since October 2020, and now sits more than 14% below its November record close. Both the Dow and S&P 500 closed out their third straight week of losses and their worst weeks since 2020. The S&P 500 is off more than 8% from its record close.
Netflix
’s disappointing quarterly report is the latest setback for technology investors. Shares of the streaming giant tumbled 21.8% on Friday after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report showed a slowdown in subscriber growth. Its competitors’ shares also declined, with Dow component Disney
, which operates the Disney+ streaming service, off 6.9%.
Netflix is the first major tech stock to report earnings this season, with Apple
and Tesla
slated to post earnings next week. Tesla lost 5.3% on Friday. Other tech names like Amazon
and Meta Platforms
fell 6% and 4.2%, respectively.
The major losses in growth names have pushed the Nasdaq Composite further into correction territory as rising rates pressure technology stocks by making their lofty valuations look less attractive.

BP deal sends Nasdaq-listed EV charging stock Tritium surging,EDT-202210:00-AM,"Despite their plans for EV charging infrastructure, both BP and Shell remain major producers of oil and gas. To the dismay of environmental groups, fossil fuels remain a key part of the global energy mix and companies continue to discover and develop oil and gas fields at locations around the world.
In March, the International Energy Agency reported that 2021 saw energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rise to their highest level in history. The IEA found energy-related global CO2 emissions increased by 6% in 2021 to reach a record high of 36.3 billion metric tons.

The U.S. passed a historic climate deal this year — here’s a recap of what’s in the bill
Why isn’t the U.S. electric grid running on 100% renewable energy yet?
Bill Gates: ‘Our grandchildren will grow up in a world that is dramatically worse off’ if we don’t fix climate changeBP’s announcement came on the same day the U.K. government published its electric vehicle infrastructure strategy, which said it expected the country would be home to roughly 300,000 public chargepoints by 2030 “as a minimum.”
BP is not alone in its attempt to lay down a marker in the electric vehicle charging market. Back in January, Shell
announced the opening of an “EV charging hub” in London. Shell said it had replaced gasoline and diesel pumps at the site with what it called “ultra-rapid chargepoints.”
The fossil fuel powerhouse is targeting the installation of 50,000 on-street chargers by the middle of the decade via its subsidiary, Ubitricity.
The need for new charging infrastructure in the U.K. is likely to become increasingly pressing in the years ahead, not least because authorities want to stop the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans by 2030. From 2035, the U.K. will require all new cars and vans to have zero-tailpipe emissions.
According to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders published at the beginning of April, new battery electric car registrations in the U.K. hit 39,315 in March, a 78.7% increase year-on-year.
“This is the highest volume of BEV registrations ever recorded in a single month, and means that more were registered in March 2022 than during the entirety of 2019,” the SMMT said.Retail traders dumping stocks en masse including record amounts of Tesla

and BP
have entered into a multi-year contract related to the supply of electric vehicle chargers, in the latest example of how energy majors are looking to cement their position in the burgeoning EV market.
According to a statement issued by Tritium on Monday, the agreement will initially center around an order of “just under 1,000 chargers” for the U.K. and Australian and New Zealand markets.
Australian firm Tritium, which was established in 2001, specializes in the development and production of direct current fast chargers for EVs. Shares of the Nasdaq-listed company rose by over 12% Monday, and opened flat on Tuesday. The stock is still down around 4% so far this year.
Toward the end of March, BP — which is better known for its oil and gas production — said it would invest £1 billion (roughly $1.3 billion) in U.K.-based electric vehicle charging infrastructure across a 10-year period.
BP said the money would “enable the deployment of more rapid and ultra-fast chargers in key locations.” The company also said its charging business, known as BP Pulse, would “approximately triple its number of charging points by 2030.”Tritium specializes in the development and production of direct current fast chargers for EVs.

Correction: Wells Fargo decreased its allowance for credit losses by $1.1 billion. An earlier version said it had set aside more money for credit losses.On Thursday, major banks including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo posted their first-quarter earnings, which investors reviewed to see how the banks navigated surging inflation.
Goldman Sachs
’ stock price fell 0.1% after reporting a first-quarter earnings beat. The bank reported per-share earnings of $10.76 on $12.93 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expected per-share earnings of $8.89 on revenue of $11.83 billion.
Shares of Morgan Stanley
popped 0.7% after the bank posted better-than-expected earnings. The firm earned $2.02 per share on revenue of $14.8 billion. Analysts expected $1.68 in per-share earnings and revenue of $14.2 billion, according to Refinitiv. The bank generated stronger-than-expected revenues from equity and fixed-income trading.
On the other hand, shares for Wells Fargo dropped 4.5% Thursday after the bank posted first-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ estimates and said credit losses were likely to increase.
“We’re still very early in earnings season, so we still have a lot more numbers to digest, but for now, the market is doing its best to stabilize after a great big sell off,” said Sarhan of 50 Park Investments.
Citigroup
, U.S. Bancorp
and Ally Financial
also reported earnings Thursday.This week’s reports of rising prices also spurred further speculation on how the central bank might respond.
“I think the data has come in exactly to support that step of policy action if the committee chooses to do so, and gives us the basis for doing it,” Federal Reserve board member Christopher Waller said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Wednesday. “I prefer a front-loading approach, so a 50-basis-point hike in May would be consistent with that, and possibly more in June and July.”
For now, investors are weighing the hot inflation data, the Fed’s next steps and first-quarter earnings as they decide how to proceed.
Retail sales figures for March slightly missed expectations with a 0.5% gain, driven by sales at gas stations, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s compared to the 0.6% consensus estimate from Dow Jones.

Supplier prices were also hotter than expected for March, gaining 11.2% from a year ago and marking the biggest gain on record going back to 2010.
Inflation fears and higher bond yields drove tech shares lower on Thursday, as investors dropped growth stocks in favor of more stable assets. Microsoft dropped 2.7%, Apple tumbled 3%, and Google slipped 2.4%. Chip stocks also slumped with Nvidia sliding about 4.3%, and Advanced Micro Devices falling about 4.8%.

The broad-market index fell 1.21% to 4,392.59, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.14% to 13,351.08. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 113.36 points, or 0.33%, to 34,451.23.

The market’s moves came as inflation took center stage in investors’ minds this week. Treasury yields climbed higher, and two back-to-back U.S. inflation reports showed sharply rising prices. On Thursday, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose back to multiyear highs, climbing 13 basis points to top 2.8%.

Traders also looked past another data set showing a sharp increase in prices amid rising hopes that inflationary pressures may be peaking.
On Wednesday, a report showed producer prices — wholesale costs that could eventually lead to higher retail prices — jumped a record 11.2% in March on an annual basis. The monthly gain of 1.4% topped the 1.1% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.7% following the producer prices report. The yield touched a three-year high of 2.82% this week before pulling back.
The producer prices report followed the consumer prices gauge released on Tuesday which showed an 8.5% surge in March, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. The report fueled further concerns of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, even as core CPI excluding food and energy costs rose 0.3%, slightly below expectations. Some on Wall Street saw this as a sign that inflation may be nearing a peak.
“I think the market appears to be reacting in a similar way that it did yesterday in response to the consumer price index,” said Jack Ablin, founding partner of Cresset Wealth. “Obviously PPI at 11 handle, to me, is mind boggling, but I think the peak inflation narrative still holds.”To be sure, shares of JPMorgan Chase fell 3.2% after the banking giant reported a $524 million hit caused by market dislocations due to sanctions against Russia. The bank also posted a 42% decline in first-quarter profits. JPMorgan did manage, however, to report $31.59 billion in revenue for the period, slightly more than expected by analysts.
CEO Jamie Dimon warned that the bank was building up credit reserves because of “higher probabilities of downside risk” to the U.S. economy.
Analysts in general have tempered expectations for the season amid rising commodity costs, the war in Ukraine and the lingering pandemic. Earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to increase just 4.5% in the period, the lowest growth since the fourth quarter of the pandemic-plagued 2020, according to FactSet.
“Our sense is that 1Q results will be ‘OK’ relative to expectations and management guidance will be more negative than positive once again,” wrote Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research. “As such, we don’t expect earnings trends coming out of 1Q reports to propel equity markets higher. Rather, our sense is that high inflation, Fed tightening, and rising recession risks will remain the key drivers of overall market returns and sector rotation.”Data is unavailable
Please contact cnbc support to provide details about what went wrongStocks rallied on Wednesday as the corporate earnings season kicked off with mostly positive results, and traders looked past surging inflation numbers.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 344.23 points, or 1.01%, to 34,564.59, accelerating gains in the final hour of trading. The S&P 500 gained 1.12% to 4,446.59, and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 2.03% to 13,643.59. Those moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted their third straight losing session on Tuesday amid March’s CPI showing the highest inflation since 1981.
Wednesday’s moves come as corporate earnings figure more prominently for investors, who are carefully monitoring for clues on how well companies are managing inflationary pressures. Fastenal

The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from a three-year high following the report as traders hoped the core reading could mean inflation is showing signs of peaking. The benchmark note fell more than 6 basis points to about 2.72% following the CPI report.
Tech stocks gave up earlier gains after popping to start the day. Microsoft and Nvidia all dropped lower, falling 1.1% and 1.9%, respectively.
Tuesday’s moves took place amid a surge in oil prices, as China eased up on Covid lockdowns that would have hurt demand. The international benchmark Brent crude jumped 6.26% to settle at $104.64 per barrel. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 6.69% to settle at $100.60 per barrel.
Energy stocks tracked oil prices upward. Occidental Petroleum jumped 2.1%. Devon Energy gained 3.7%. Marathon Oil popped about 4.2%, and Chevron spiked nearly 2.1%.
Investors are also awaiting the start of earnings season set to kick off Wednesday with JPMorgan and Delta Air Lines, followed by several big banks on Thursday.Citi’s Chronert says a recession is near; shares his ‘top conviction calls’ to tough it out

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyConsumer prices in March surged 8.5% from a year ago, slightly higher than expected and at their highest levels since 1981, according to data from the Labor Department on Tuesday. Meanwhile, core CPI — which excludes food and energy prices — rose less than expected; it climbed 0.3% in March, while economists polled by Dow Jones expected a gain of 0.5%. Core prices on an annual basis were up 6.5%.
The high inflation numbers raised expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which investors fear could slow the economy. The Fed raised rates at its March meeting, and it’s expected to hike more throughout the year.
“I think the Fed has to continue at least 50-basis-point hikes for a number of meetings,” Wharton School finance professor Jeremy Siegel told CNBC’s “Halftime Report” on Tuesday. One basis point equals 0.01 percentage points. “The Fed really has to get above 3%, 3.5% if it wants to slow the inflation, which I still think is moving through the system.”Data is unavailable

Nasdaq 100 plummets after record rally. Two traders bet on more gains ahead,EST-20217:00-AM,"There may be some short-term volatility, but the Nasdaq 100 has enough long-term tailwinds to keep its momentum going, according to Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital.
“There are so many factors that are moving in the right direction for the Nasdaq and for these tech companies. The confirmation of Chairman Powell creates some stability; there’s so much money on the sidelines, which also helps that drive [them] higher, but also we’re in the middle of a technological revolution. I really just believe it’s going to continue for the next five to 10 years,” Bapis said during the same interview.
It’s not just the tech names, though. Bapis highlighted some of the non-tech outperformers such as Costco that have kept the Nasdaq moving higher.
“You have the undervalued non-tech names on the Nasdaq that are performing quite reasonably well and they’re going to continue to perform well as we see the shift from growth to value while the major tech names that make up so much in the Nasdaq are moving in a positive direction,” he said.

“Apple is just getting going again and that really tells the story for the index overall where you have … Apple breaking above its September peak, really marking a resumption I think of what was a larger breakout above these stocks’ 2020 peaks.

“I absolutely love that the stocks are all looking awful. I mean that’s what you want,” Cramer said, as someone who wants to buy low and sell high. “Some of these stocks are cut in half. I’m looking at stocks cut in half where they’re making money.” He added, reiterating his investing theme for 2022, “The ones not making money I’m still not interested in.”
Cramer’s remarks came as Nasdaq futures moved lower Thursday, even as Dow futures edged higher. The Nasdaq’s slide on Wednesday was its biggest one-day loss since February 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
and S&P 500
on Wednesday fell 1% and nearly 2%, respectively, after closing at record highs earlier this week.
Cramer said he was encouraged by the Nasdaq’s premarket drop Thursday because “eventually sellers exhaust themselves.”

Tech’s big Friday rally helps Nasdaq avoid first five-week losing streak since 2012,EST-20224:16-PM,"Driven by Google and YouTube ads, Alphabet is expected to report another quarter of hefty growth at close to 27%, but analysts anticipate a significant moderation this year into the teens.
Between Google’s commentary on Tuesday and Meta’s Facebook numbers the next day, investors should start to get a clear picture on the trajectory of online ads and whether big spenders are feeling any sort of a pinch. Meta is expected to show revenue growth of about 19% in the fourth quarter, its slowest expansion rate since mid-2020, with analysts expecting annual growth for 2022 to be cut almost in half to 19% from last year’s level.
Google and Facebook have both proven they can withstand all sorts of challenges in recent years, ranging from the pandemic shutdowns and regulatory pressure to Apple’s iOS privacy changes. Their dominance over web audiences means that even when marketers pull back their spending, they keep investing their dollars in ways that allow them to target the largest number of consumers on the internet and on mobile devices.
Argus Research wrote in an earnings preview last week that Meta’s “most perilous near-term risks arise from regulatory investigations and intense critical coverage in the media.”
Still, the firm has a buy recommendation on the stock and a $410 price target, which represents a 36% increase from Friday’s price.
Meta may be better positioned to weather the storm because of “the secular trend of advertisers moving to digital from other channels and since much of its revenue comes from direct-response advertising by e-commerce sites,” Argus wrote.
Amazon’s results on Thursday will cover the critical holiday period. Analysts expect to see growth of close to 10% in the fourth quarter over a year earlier. But as with Facebook and Google, Amazon’s control over the e-commerce market has investors convinced that regardless of any concerns about consumer spending, they’ll keep relying on one site in particular for their speedy and low-cost deliveries.
Amazon’s growth in 2022 is expected to come in at 17%, a slight drop-off from about 22% last year.
WATCH: What happens to products when you return them to Amazon“Despite the component shortages, the company continues to demonstrate the strength of its product ecosystem with broad-based growth across its lineup,” wrote analysts at Canaccord Genuity, in a report after Apple’s announcement. They maintained their buy rating on the stock.
Apple, the most valuable U.S. company, climbed 7% on Friday, helping lift the Nasdaq by 3%, with much of the gain coming just before trading closed. Still, the index is down 12% in January and poised to close out its worst month since 2008.
All eyes turn to next week, when the rest of the mega-cap tech group, along with other key tech suppliers, will report quarterly results.

and Atlassian all posted decisive beats.
All that happened this week. And it was just barely enough to keep the Nasdaq from extending its losing streak to five weeks, which would’ve been the longest such stretch since late 2012. The tech-heavy index rose 0.01% over the past five days after Friday’s Apple-fueled rally.

rose 57% last year, and Cramer said he thinks the stock has become one that investors should own, not trade.
Sign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer’s every move in the market.
Disclosure: Cramer’s charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia, Marvell Technology, AMD and Alphabet.Similarly to Atlassian, Cramer said he likes Zscaler
as a company but believes the cybersecurity stock, which rose 61% in 2021, is tough to own at this current moment.Cramer said he’s a fan of Atlassian
, which makes tools for software developers, as a company.
“I like the product, seems indispensable to many,” Cramer said. “But this is one that’s just totally out of style, so if you want to stick with it, you need to get used to pain.”Google-parent Alphabet
saw its stock jump 65% last year. While some may say it’s just catching up to its mega-cap tech peers, Cramer said the stock’s story is more complicated than that. The company benefited from the rebound in advertising spending from industries such as travel, Cramer said, adding that investors are also expecting big things from the Google Cloud division.Cramer said he believes Intuit
—which has TurboTax, QuickBooks and Credit Karma in its product suite — has the best chance of any company on the list to repeat its “terrific” 2021 performance this year. Cramer touted Intuit’s aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years and said it’s become an indispensable company for small and medium-sized businesses. It rose nearly 70% in 2021.Cramer said even though Datadog
is considered a best-of-breed company in the world of cloud-based data analytics and monitoring, he believes investors are better suited in a different part of the stock market right now.
“This thing lost 8% of its value yesterday for no particular reason and then tumbled another 3.7% today. ... It’s not the kind of stock you can afford to own when rates are on the rise,” Cramer said.Cramer said he believes investors should look to own Applied Materials
, shares of which rose 82% in 2021, or one of its fellow semiconductor equipment makers such as KLA Corp
. and ASML
. KLA was the ninth-best performer in the Nasdaq 100, while ASML was No. 11.
Cramer cited the long-term demand trends, as semiconductors become integral to a growing number of products from cell phones to automobiles. “Think of them as the limited arms dealers in the semiconductor cold war. I’d buy them on any dip, however shallow,” he said.Cramer jumped to the fifth-best performer, Marvell Technology
, because he discussed numbers 2-4 — Moderna
, Fortinet
and Nvidia
, respectively — on Monday’s episode of “Mad Money” as part of a segment on the top S&P 500 stocks.
For Marvell, Cramer noted he’s long been a fan of the semiconductor company, which has undergone a reinvention under the leadership of President and CEO Matt Murphy. “I think it can keep working in 2022 because this is a real company with real products and real profits. Notice, it was barely off today even as the rest of tech melted down,” Cramer said.Lucid Group
shares rose 280% in 2021, and Cramer said he knows many investors are justifiably looking for “the next Tesla.” However, he cautioned that Lucid is still in the early stages of scaling up production.
“As much as I love the story, I hate the timing, especially with another lockup expiration ... coming later this month,” he said. “The last one crushed the stock.”CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Tuesday broke down some of the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 in 2021, offering his thoughts on how investors should approach them in the new year.

Those latest inductees received the Nasdaq’s seal of approval, but what about investors? CNBC’s “Trading Nation” asked its traders on Monday for their favorite of the bunch.
Delano Saporu, founder of New Street Advisors, said Palo Alto Networks looks best positioned here.
“It has had an incredible year, but it still might be a good stocking stuffer if folks are looking to add to their IT infrastructure stocks,” Saporu said.
Palo Alto Networks has risen more than 50% in 2021, better than the broader market. The SKYY cloud computing ETF, which holds shares in Palo Alto, has climbed just 10%.  
“The network security side of the business, the cloud security side of the business, and the security operations side of the business, all those segments hadn’t had less than 10 new major product releases over the last three fiscal years. That tells me that the company is doing a great job of keeping up with infrastructure and IT demands,” Saporu said.
He calls it a “market leader” in the space and a stock that should benefit from the “secular growth story.”
Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, does not expect the addition to the Nasdaq 100 to have a net benefit for any of the incoming stocks. However, one inclusion and removal pairing could give the index a boost.
“Probably the industry pair that I think ultimately ends up helping the index’s performance is the addition of Palo Alto and the removal of Check Point Software. I think Palo Alto ends up doing better relative to the market, breaking to the upside,” Wald said during the same interview."

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe slide in tech ended a three-day rally for the Nasdaq. Tech stocks have been volatile to start 2022 as the Federal Reserve has signaled it will fight inflation aggressively this year, including rate hikes and potentially reducing its balance sheet.
“When the Fed is not your friend, you sell rallies,” said Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Advisory Group. Boockvar noted that several large tech stocks took a step down at around the same time in midday trading.
“Someone said ‘get me out of tech,’” he added.
Strong earnings reports provided some positives for the market on Thursday. Delta Air Lines
posted a beat on profit and revenue and reaffirmed full-year guidance, sending its shares up more than 2%. Shares of homebuilder KB Home
rallied more than 16% after reporting better-than-expected earnings.
Elsewhere, Dow component Boeing
rose nearly 3% following a Bloomberg News report that the company’s 737 Max could resume service in China as soon as this month.
Thursday’s market moves came as another inflation report showed a historically high rise in prices but was not as bad as some economists feared. The December producer price index rose 0.2% month over month. That was below the 0.4% expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. However, the measure was up 9.7% year over year, which is the highest on record going back to 2010.
That report follows Wednesday’s December consumer price index, a key inflation measure, which increased 7% year over year, according to the department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was the highest annual reading since 1982, but the report was largely in line with expectations.
Despite those readings, interest rates have dipped, partially unwinding sharp moves in the opposite directions last week. Stocks had risen as well, but Thursday’s sell-off made the three major averages negative for the week.
“We expect the US 10-year yield to move ... to around 2% over the coming months, as investors digest the Fed’s more hawkish stance along with further elevated inflation readings. That said, we don’t expect a sharp rise in yields that will imperil the equity rally. Year-over-year inflation is still likely to peak in the first quarter and recede over the year,” UBS strategists led by senior economist Brian Rose said in a note on Thursday.U.S. stocks struggled on Thursday as a rebound in tech stocks faded, erasing gains from earlier this week.
The S&P 500 slid 1.42% to 4,659.03, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.51% to 14,806.81. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 176.70 points to close at 36,113.62 after rising more than 200 points earlier in the day.
Weakness in Big Tech stocks, including drops of 2.4% for Amazon and 4.2% for Microsoft, weighed on the Nasdaq. Shares of Snap dropped roughly 10%, while Virgin Galactic slid nearly 19% after the space exploration company announced a debt offering. Electric vehicle stock Tesla shed more than 6%."
"Dow rises 180 points, Nasdaq rallies for second day as tech shares rebound",EST-20224:45-PM,"Tuesday’s market moves follow a sharp rally on Monday afternoon, which saw the Nasdaq erase a 2.7% loss to finish slightly higher and snap a four-day losing streak.

Citi’s Chronert says a recession is near; shares his ‘top conviction calls’ to tough it out
Goldman Sachs reveals 7 under-the-radar global stocks to buy this year
Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyFed Chair Jerome Powell testified before a Senate committee on Tuesday as part of his re-confirmation process. Powell said that he expected a normalized supply chain to help ease inflation pressures in 2022 but said the Fed would not be afraid to hike rates further than projected if inflation remains high.
“If we have to raise interest rates more over time, we will. We will use our tools to get inflation back,” Powell said.
However, stocks and bonds both moved higher during Powell’s testimony as he did not announce an accelerated change in policy from what the central bank had already signaled.
“Powell noted that the balance sheet runoff will occur later in 2022 and that ‘it’s a long road back to normal’. On net, the Chair’s comments are consistent with a willingness to deliver the liftoff hike in March assuming there isn’t a dramatic reversal in the pace of consumer price gains,” Ian Lyngen of BMO said in a note to clients.U.S. stocks rose again on Tuesday as Wall Street appeared to find its footing after a rocky start to the new year.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
gained 1.41% to 15,153.45, building on an afternoon rally from the previous session that snapped a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500
rose 0.92% to 4,713.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average
added 183.15 points, or 0.51%, to close at 36,252.02.
Stocks have been volatile to start the year, as rising interest rates have put pressure on equities. However, interest rates cooled on Tuesday, with the 10-year Treasury yield slipping below 1.75%.
“More than anything, it’s just a reprieve from some pretty extreme selling we’ve had over the past number of weeks, really since the beginning of the year,” said Jeff Mills, chief investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Wealth Management.
“I think it’s probably premature to call this some sort of a bottom in tech. I think you’re just getting at least one day of reprieve given the move in rates,” Mills added.
Large-cap tech stocks helped support the broader market, with Amazon
rising 2.4% and shares of Apple
and Nvidia
gaining roughly 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Other notable gainers included Illumina
, which rose 17% after the genomic sequencing company issued a 2022 revenue outlook that was ahead of consensus.
Elsewhere, shares of Exxon Mobil
rose more than 4% as U.S. oil prices topped $80 per barrel. At-home fitness stock Peloton
jumped 6.4%."
"Nasdaq rallies on Monday afternoon to snap losing streak, erasing loss of more than 2%",EST-20225:08-PM,"Monday’s moves came ahead of a busy week of economic data and central bank news. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to testify Tuesday at his nomination hearing before a Senate panel, while the hearing on Fed Governor Lael Brainard’s nomination to the post of vice chair is set for Thursday. While both are expected to be confirmed, the hearings could provide key information about the future of monetary policy.
The consumer price index is set for release Wednesday and is expected to show a year-over-year increase of 7.1%, according to Dow Jones estimates. The producer price index, which measures wholesale prices, is slated for Thursday.
Earnings season also begins this week, with financial heavyweights JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo release quarterly results Friday.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon struck an optimistic tone on Monday, telling CNBC that he expected strong growth this year even though he saw the Fed raising rates more than four times over the course of the year.
“We’re going to have the best growth we’ve ever had this year, I think, since maybe sometime after the Great Depression,” Dimon told CNBC’s Bertha Coombs during the 40th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.
“The market can have its own fluctuations unrelated to the economy, and I think you need this kind of growth to justify the market. We’re kind of expecting that the volatility will have a lot of volatility this year as rates go up,” Dimon added.
Even with Monday’s upturn, stocks are still down sharply for the year. The S&P 500 has fallen for five consecutive days and is down 2% since the start of January. The Nasdaq is down more than 4% year to date.
Elsewhere, shares of video game publisher Take-Two fell more than 13% after the company announced a deal to purchase Zynga. Retail stocks Nike and Tapestry fell 4.2% and 4.7%, respectively. Lululemon fell nearly 2% after the company said the omicron variant had hurt its fourth-quarter results.U.S. stocks staged an afternoon rally on Monday as major tech stocks reversed earlier losses, helping the Nasdaq Composite snap a four-day losing streak.
The Nasdaq closed with a gain of 0.05% at 14,942.83 after falling more than 2% earlier in the day. The S&P 500 closed down 0.14% at 4,670.29 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a loss of 162.79 points, or 0.45%, at 36,068.87, also well off session lows.
Large-cap tech stocks were under pressure in early trading but were able to stabilize and then move higher as the day wore on. Nvidia, Tesla and Apple all closed higher after losing ground earlier in the session.
The rough start to the year for stocks has come as interest rates have spiked. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield briefly traded above 1.8% on Monday morning after ending 2021 near 1.51%, but settled back below that level later in the day. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs projected the Federal Reserve will hike rates four times in 2022, signaling that Wall Street increasingly expects the central bank aggressively attempt to curb inflation.
However, the market appeared to be nearing key technical levels on Monday. At its lowest point, the Nasdaq was more than 9% below its record closing high from November, putting it on the verge of a correction. JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a midday note that investors should buy the dip in stocks.
Shannon Saccocia, CIO of Boston Private Wealth, said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” that the economy should be able to handle a further rise in interest rates.
“Buying the dip in some of these high valuation growth stocks, not necessarily what I’d do today. But I do think from an economic standpoint we are looking at continued growth over the next several quarters ... so there’s a lot of positives here that offset some of what’s happening in the interest rate environment,” Saccocia said."
S&P 500 and Nasdaq fall for a fourth day on spiking rates to cap the first trading week of 2022,EST-20226:44-PM,"On Friday, the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added far fewer jobs in December than expected. The nonfarm payrolls report showed an increase of 199,000 in December, though economists had expected growth of 422,000, according to Dow Jones.
While the headline number disappointed, there were some things in this jobs report that pointed to an improving economic picture and higher inflation. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.6%, above expectations. And the unemployment rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest level since February 2020 and well below the 4.1% expected.
So after some digestion following the jobs report, yields continued their march higher.
Software stocks were among the hardest hit shares for the week amid the rotation out of tech, with Salesforce down 10%, and Adobe down more than 9% for the week. CrowdStrike moved 7.7% lower. Nearly all megacap tech stocks finished the week lower. Netflix has lost 10% for the week, Microsoft which ended the day slightly higher, fell 6.6% for the week. Alphabet fell more than 5%.
However, while tech stocks drove most of the market losses, value names showed strength, particularly among energy and financial stocks. Schlumberger and Hess climbed about 17% for the week. Wells Fargo rose 14.1% this week, and Regions Financial gained 15.2%.
Elsewhere, GameStop shares jumped 7.3% Friday following news that the company is venturing into the crypto world with investments in a marketplace for nonfungible tokens and digital currency partnerships to create games and other items.“A shift in Fed policy often injects volatility into markets,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist.
Tech stocks lost ground further on Friday as yields jumped. With rates rising rapidly, investors are dumping riskier stocks trading on high valuations based on estimates of profit growth far off in the future.
Microchip Technology was one of the biggest decliners in the Nasdaq, down 3.9%. Other semiconductor stocks fell too, with Nvidia and AMD both down more than 3%. Netflix fell 2.2%. Twilio lost 3.5%.Data is unavailable

The Nasdaq Composite dropped another 0.9% on Friday to close at 14,935.90. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% to 4,677.03 for its first four-day losing streak since September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.81 points, or about 0.01%, to close at 36,231.66.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst week since February 2021, down about 4.5% in the first five trading days of 2022. The S&P 500 was off by 1.8%, while the Dow lost only 0.29% as investors rotated into some value stocks amid the rise in rates.
“The stock market is undergoing somewhat of a transition right now, after a very strong 2021,” said Jay Pestrichelli, co-founder of ZEGA Financial. “We are seeing more volatility in individual stocks compared to the indexes, and we are seeing a change in leadership in the market, as investors reconsider the high-flying tech stocks of 2021 as interest rates rise.”
The 10-year Treasury yield
topped 1.8% on Friday, continuing its 2022 run from a 2021 year-end level of just 1.51%. The release of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes on Wednesday were the major catalyst for the rate move. The meeting notes showed the central bank is ready to dial back its economic help more rapidly than some had anticipated, including taking steps to shrink its balance sheet while raising rates."

However, he said, “on this list, I think T-Mobile gives you the best chance of a bounce now that it’s arguably the best network in the nation.”

in his charitable investment trust, even though it was a rough 2021 and fintech stocks remain out of favor on Wall Street. “Be careful for now. This stock is one step forward and then one step back, as we’ve seen almost exactly in the last couple days,” he said.MercadoLibre
, which is seen as “the eBay of Latin America,” is doing incredibly well from a business standpoint, Cramer said. However, he said valuation concerns were a major reason why the company’s stock fell about 20% in 2021.
“The stock sells at more than 400 times last year’s earnings, and nobody wants that kind of high-flier in this new environment where the Fed is no longer your friend,” Cramer said.“Like Zoom, DocuSign
needs [to do] something to show that it’s taken advantage of its newfound size and reach. So far, it has not done so,” Cramer said. “This is not a niche company, but I fear it could end up being like fintech — destined to fall back to earth — and it still might have a long way to go.”Even after last year’s 32% decline, Cramer said he views Splunk
’s stock as a sell until the company offers greater transparency into the departure of former CEO Doug Merritt, who stepped down in November.Cramer said he thinks investors shouldn’t completely give up on Zoom
, even after a tough 2021, because the company has tremendous potential to grow as a player in the enterprise software category. “However, as long as Zoom tries to go it alone, its price to earnings multiple will keep shrinking,” Cramer said. “Currently it trades at roughly 40 times earnings, and I bet it can get even cheaper.”Pinduoduo

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose for the first day in four on Tuesday after Russia appeared to be backing away from an immediate invasion of Ukraine, cooling geopolitical tensions that have knocked the stock market down the last three days.
The Russian Defense Ministry said it had begun returning some troops to deployment bases after training exercises near the Ukrainian border.
The Dow jumped 422.67 points, or 1.2%, to 34,988.84 helped by a 3.7% jump in Boeing
. The S&P 500 climbed 1.6% to 4,471.07, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.5% to 14,139.76. All three major benchmarks were down in the three prior sessions. The S&P 500 is about 7% from its record high. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 rallied 2.8% on Tuesday.
Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said troops who had recently been posted to Russia’s southern and western military districts — which share a border with Ukraine — had completed their drills and “have already begun loading onto rail and road transport and will begin moving to their military garrisons today.”
President Joe Biden addressed the conflict on Tuesday afternoon, saying the United States will defend NATO members if the conflict intensifies.
“If Russia proceeds, we will rally the world,” Biden said, adding that Washington’s allies were ready to impose powerful sanctions that will “undermine Russia’s ability to compete economically and strategically.”
WTI crude prices fell roughly 3.6%, while the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.04% as tensions eased. The VanEck Russia ETF
, a U.S.-traded fund which invests in big Russian stocks, rose 5.8%.
Airline and cruise stocks led the gainers while energy companies were the biggest losers as oil prices fell. American Airlines

“De-escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine are helping overall sentiment today, but that isn’t the only good news. US Covid cases are now down 80% from their January peak, another sign the reopening will be moving forward,” said Ryan Detrick of LPL Financial.
In addition to the Ukraine drama, investors got another look at the inflation picture on Tuesday.
The producer price index, which measures final-demand goods and services, increased 1% for the month, against the Dow Jones estimate for 0.5%. Over the past 12 months the gauge rose an unadjusted 9.7%. Excluding food, energy and trade services, co-called core PPI increased 0.9% for the month, topping the 0.4% estimate.
“News that Russia is pulling back some of its troops from the Ukraine border is fueling a bid to equity prices and a retreat in oil prices,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “However, NATO is still awaiting confirmation of the pullback, and in the meantime wholesale prices in the US started the year rising at an accelerated pace. This underscores that the Fed is behind the inflation curve, they will need to front-load tightening for this year.”
Wall Street is coming off a volatile Monday trading session. The Dow closed lower by more than 170 points. The S&P 500 dropped as much as 1.2% before ending the day 0.4% lower. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.9% at one point before closing just below the flatline.
Those moves came as the Russia-Ukraine conflict had appeared to escalate. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ordered the closing of the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine on Monday, citing a “dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces” on Ukraine’s border.
Concerns over multiple Fed rate hikes also kept investors on edge.
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC’s Steve Liesman on Monday that the central bank needs to be aggressive in fighting inflation. The consumer price index rose last month at its fastest year-over-year pace since 1982, leading Citigroup and Goldman Sachs to increase their rate hike outlook for 2022 to seven.
“I do think we need to front-load more of our planned removal of accommodation than we would have previously. We’ve been surprised to the upside on inflation. This is a lot of inflation,” Bullard said.
“Our credibility is on the line here and we do have to react to the data,” he added. “However, I do think we can do it in a way that’s organized and not disruptive to markets.”
The Fed releases minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday. Investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes, the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet.
 “If the reveal is the Fed believes they’re behind the curve... that is interesting, and will have investors on their back foot. They’ll be thinking even more rate hikes and additional tightening,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist State Street Global Advisors.

"German space lasers company Mynaric CEO talks Nasdaq IPO, plans for growth",EST-202111:56-AM,"The company has not yet sent a full laser terminal to space, but has performed aircraft flight tests that were successful. Mynaric is hoping to perform an in-space demonstration in the second quarter of next year, but Altan noted that schedule is “fluid” and depends on the company’s customers.
Altan said Mynaric decided to list on the Nasdaq because “you have an investor base in the U.S. that understands the space market and has been active in it quite a while.”
“The whole space industry is coming in Europe, but in the U.S. it has established itself,” he said.
Altan – who spent more than a decade at SpaceX, most recently as the vice president of satellite mission assurance – said that Elon Musk’s company is not a Mynaric customer. SpaceX is “very vertically integrated,” Altan said, and the laser communications technology that Starlink satellites are using is different from Mynaric’s, making chances of a customer relationship “low.”
“I think being a technology partner would be a better avenue for us to explore,” Altan said of SpaceX. The company notably nominated former SpaceX vice president Hans Koenigsmann to join Mynaric’s supervisory board earlier this fall.
The other motivation for Mynaric’s listing was that its “customer base is now very U.S.-centric,” Altan said – including companies such as Northrop Grumman and imagery start-up Capella.
“The government right now is buying so many laser communication terminals indirectly, by procuring a high number of satellites with laser communication capability,” Altan said.
For now Mynaric is well capitalized, he said, with no “immediate need” to raise more money. It has a facility that can build as many as 400 laser terminals per year, but Mynaric plans to increase that to 2,000 per year.
“The underlying technology is really mass production oriented,” Altan said.German laser communications company Mynaric
listed on the Nasdaq in the past week and CEO Bulent Altan, a former SpaceX executive, spoke to CNBC about the company’s U.S. debut and plans for further growth.
The company raised $75.9 million through its initial public offering, with the stock priced at $16.50 a share. The stock is up slightly since then, having closed at $18.19 a share on Thursday.
Mynaric makes optical communication terminals, a device which uses a laser to send data from one point to another. Altan explained that Mynaric’s target market is companies building satellite constellations, including for broadband, earth imagery, and more.
“This isn’t just a space pure play; it’s almost a constellations pure play,” Altan said, highlighting that most satellite companies are not public, giving SpaceX’s Starlink as a notable example of a constellation operated by a firm that may one day IPO but has not yet.German laser communications company Mynaric recently listed on the Nasdaq, and CEO Bulent Altan, a former SpaceX executive, spoke to CNBC about the company’s U.S. initial public offering.

"Dow adds 499 points, Nasdaq climbs 2% as investors shake off slow start to week",EDT-20228:22-PM,"“I think a lot of it has to do with those defensive names that did so well, you’re just kind of getting this rotation. But tech up as much it is today with real yields moving much higher, that’s not a normal occurrence,” Smith said.
Earnings reports drove individual stock moves Tuesday. Johnson & Johnson reported mixed quarterly results, with its earnings per share topping earnings expectations while revenue missed analyst estimates. Its shares rose 3%, however, boosting the Dow.
Hasbro shares added about 5% despite the toy company posting a weaker-than-expected profit for the previous quarter. Its revenue was in line with estimates. Travelers Companies dropped 4.9% and Lockheed Martin shares lost 1.6% after posting mixed results.
On the data front, housing starts and building permits in March came in above expectations, according to estimates from Dow Jones. That appeared to boost homebuilder stocks, with D.R. Horton gaining 3.9%.
“So far the economic data has been holding up fairly well, so there is some underlying strength even though recession worries are growing and voices about a growth slowdown are getting louder,” said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
The energy market may have helped trader sentiment on Tuesday, with prices for oil and natural gas both declining sharply. Kourkafas said the declines may have provided “some relief” for investors worried about inflation.
Elsewhere, travel stocks also performed well in the wake of the mask mandate for airlines being lifted following a court decision Monday. Shares of American Airlines gained more than 5%, while United climbed 4.5%.
Traders also kept an eye on the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2.94%, its highest level since 2018. Expectations for Fed hikes have risen sharply in recent months, though the central bank has said it will be data dependent in deciding how it will hike rates throughout the year.
The concern about the Fed’s next steps have caused high volatility in the bond market as well, which appears to have weighed on stocks in recent weeks. St. Louis Fed president James Bullard told CNBC’s Steve Liesman on Monday that “quite a bit has been priced in” in terms of Fed actions.

Wednesday’s gains were highlighted by some of the same stocks that outperformed during the pandemic lockdowns in 2020. E-commerce stock Shopify gained more than 5%, while Etsy gained 3.8%. Stay-at-home favorites such as DocuSign and Zoom Video jumped 5.2% and 4.8%, respectively.
Facebook-parent Meta, which had pulled back dramatically after issuing disappointing guidance last week, saw its stock bounce 5.4% on Wednesday.
Wednesday marked the second straight positive day for the Nasdaq, and the average has gained more than 8% since its recent closing low on Jan. 27 after falling into correction territory earlier this year.
“You have a lot of different constituents in the markets these days. You’ll have the guys who are trading short-term, and obviously for a lot of the stay-at-home stocks we saw get pummeled over the last few months are at much lower multiple levels that make them attractive on a trade basis,” said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at MissionSquare Retirement.
On the other hand, investors who are more fundamentally oriented could be bidding up stocks that could benefit from a strong economy, as the pandemic becomes less of a worry for consumers, such as travel stocks, Wicker said.
Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings rose 4.3%, and Delta Air Lines added nearly 3%, on Wednesday as concerns about omicron fade from the market. New York State announced on Wednesday that it was lifting its indoor mask mandate.
On the earnings front, Chipotle

gained 6.8% despite announcing it had fewer active riders than in the prior quarter.
Solar stock Enphase Energy surged 12% after the company beat estimates on the top and bottom lines for the fourth quarter and delivered upbeat guidance. The result appeared to boost other stocks in the burgeoning industry as well, with SolarEdge Technologies jumping nearly 7%.
As of the opening bell on Wednesday, roughly 60% of all S&P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings and about 77% have topped Wall Street’s earnings estimates, according to FactSet. Disney

will release results after the bell on Wednesday.
Investors are also preparing for Thursday’s Consumer Price Index report, which will give an update on the inflation picture. The Fed has already signaled a monetary policy pivot in order to address the historically high price increases.
The inflation data is estimated to show that prices rose 0.4% in January, for a 7.2% gain from one year ago, according to Dow Jones.
“If you had asked me last week, I would have said well, a lower number, the market’s going to really rock because the market is pretty oversold. Well now we’ve come back quite a bit, so I think that the risk-reward is even,” said Andrew Slimmon, managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
“What we’re counseling investors is hey, take advantage of the drawdowns. Don’t chase when the market comes roaring back. And I suppose now it has come back quite a bit,” Slimmon added.
Bond yields cooled slightly Wednesday amid a dramatic surge in 2022, possibly giving a boost to tech. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded near 1.945% after touching 1.97% on Tuesday."

Corporate earnings were driving stock moves on Tuesday. Harley-Davidson jumped more than 15% after the company reported a surprise profit for the fourth quarter. Amgen and Chegg rose 7.8% and nearly 16%, respectively, following their quarterly updates.
Shares of American Express rose 3.3% and JPMorgan gained 1.9%, boosting the Dow.
“The S&P 500 reversed losses as Wall Street rotated into materials, technology, and financial stocks,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a note to clients. “Now that we are both over the hump with earnings season and investors are prepared for another hot inflation report, the ongoing rotation trade will likely continue. Today, traders are finding value in tech and embracing financials as global bond yields steadily increase.”
It was a broad rally for stocks on Tuesday, with gainers in the S&P 500 outnumbering decliners by more than 2 to 1. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose more than 1.6%.
Wall Street has been on edge watching how the Federal Reserve will react to the intensifying price pressures, with many investors eyeing Thursday’s consumer price index data release as a key event for markets this week. The inflation data is expected to show that prices rose 0.4% in January, for a 7.2% gain from one year ago, which would be the highest in almost 40 years.
Treasury yields hit fresh pandemic-era highs Monday and rose again Tuesday. At its highest, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yielded 1.97% on Tuesday, a level not seen since November 2019.
“It’s reasonable to expect that stocks are going to be in a holding pattern before Thursday’s CPI release. I think it is encouraging we are seeing the market absorb the rise in long-term yields pretty well,” said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
“At this point it is a tug-of-war between solid corporate and economic fundamentals and monetary policy tightening,” he added.
On the downside, Pfizer shares slid 2.8% after the drugmaker’s fourth-quarter revenue came in lower than Wall Street analysts expected. Pfizer’s full-year earnings guidance also disappointed.
As of Tuesday morning, about 300 S&P 500 components have reported, with 77% exceeding earnings estimates and 75% topping revenue expectations, according to FactSet. However, the strong results have not been enough to dig the market out of the hole created by January’s slide, and weak forward guidance may be part of what is holding back a rebound.
“Despite a solid beat this quarter, guidance weakened significantly. ... Guidance is also sparser than usual – we note only 76 instances of EPS guidance issuance in [January], slightly below last Jan and the lowest of any Jan,” Bank of America’s Savita Subramanian said in a note to clients.

“With an eye on this week’s CPI inflation report Thursday, investors may be returning from the weekend with renewed commitment to avoiding the longer duration stocks today,” Chris Hussey from Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients on Monday.

Corporate earnings were again a source of volatility for stocks on Monday. Tyson Foods gained more than 12% after beating earnings expectations, while medical device maker Zimmer Biomet fell 9% after its report.
Meanwhile, shares of Facebook-parent Meta fell more than 5%, continuing a post-earnings slide. The stock has now dropped 30% since the company’s quarterly report last Wednesday. And shares of Netflix, still struggling after the media giant issued weak guidance in January, fell another 2% on Monday after investment firm Needham said the company’s current strategy could not win the streaming wars.
“Investor psychology is shifting almost week-to-week, meaning sticking to one’s investment convictions is about as hard (or painful) as ever, but also never more important in driving outperformance,” Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt said in a note to clients. “Our conviction remains that economic strength will keep EPS keeps going higher along with interest rates, as we suspect we remain a long way from higher rates materially slowing demand in the economy.”

SEC approves Nasdaq’s plan to boost diversity on corporate boards,EDT-20214:25-PM,"Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee blasted the plan when Nasdaq first released it in December. The group categorized Nasdaq’s move as excessive and an example of a company inappropriately advocating a political agenda.
Sen. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the committee, on Friday panned the SEC’s decision and Nasdaq’s effort.
“Corporate board rooms, like all organizations, can benefit from a diversity of perspectives, but NASDAQ’s one-size-fits-all quota misses the mark,” he said in an emailed statement. “By defining diversity by race, gender, and sexual orientation, NASDAQ’s mandate will inevitably pressure companies to subordinate crucial factors such as knowledge, experience, and expertise when selecting board members.”
“I’m disappointed Chairman Gensler is turning a financial regulator into a laboratory for progressive social engineering,” he added.
Toomey asked then-nominee Gensler in March if he believed boards should be “forced or pressured to comply with some sort of quota with respect to race, gender or sexual orientation.”
Gensler replied by touting the benefits of diversity more broadly and among the ranks at the commission. Democrats and some companies, including Goldman Sachs, have supported Nasdaq’s initiative.Read more of CNBC’s politics coverage:

View MoreThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved new Nasdaq rules that will require companies that list shares on its exchanges to meet certain race and gender targets.
The announcement by Wall Street’s top regulator marks the end of a monthslong debate at the SEC on whether to approve novel changes at one of the globe’s largest market exchange operators.
The rules will ensure company boards meet gender and racial diversity requirements or force firms to explain in writing why they have failed to do so.
Nasdaq’s goal for most U.S. companies is to have at least one woman director in addition to another board member who self-identifies as a member of a racial minority or the LGBTQ community.
“These rules will allow investors to gain a better understanding of Nasdaq-listed companies’ approach to board diversity, while ensuring that those companies have the flexibility to make decisions that best serve their shareholders,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a statement. 
“These rules reflect calls from investors for greater transparency about the people who lead public companies, and a broad cross-section of commenters supported the proposed board diversity disclosure rule,” he added.
The rule changes also require firms to release diversity statistics about their boards. Nasdaq found in a study conducted in 2020 that more than 75% of its listed companies wouldn’t have met its proposed requirements.
The exchange operator applauded the SEC’s order in a press release.
“We are pleased that the SEC has approved Nasdaq’s proposal to enhance board diversity disclosures and encourage the creation of more diverse boards through a market-led solution,” Nasdaq said. “We look forward to working with our companies to implement this new listing rule and set a new standard for corporate governance.”The SEC on Friday approved Nasdaq’s push to require race and gender disclosures in its listing rules.
The first-of-its-kind proposal would require companies listed on the Nasdaq to meet certain minimum targets for gender and racial diversity of their boards.
“These rules will allow investors to gain a better understanding of Nasdaq-listed companies’ approach to board diversity,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said."

"Hedge your tech positions with this Nasdaq 100 trade, market analyst says",EDT-20216:35-PM,"“If the Nasdaq were to break through this key uptrend support, a likely stopping point could be this old high” around $13,805, where it traded in February and April of this year, Gordon said.
To guard against that possibility, Gordon — who owns several tech stocks and ETFs — set up a put spread on the Nasdaq 100, buying the $14,500 puts expiring on Oct. 11 and Oct. 13 and selling the $14,000 puts. That expects the Nasdaq to see a moderate decline and carries less risk than an individual put or short strategy.
If the Nasdaq 100 falls to $14,000 by expiration, Gordon’s trade would make $39,230, he said, adding that the trade’s structure makes it easy to exit if it’s not working out.
“It’s better, I feel, to do that rather than try to exit a lot of your underlying positions,” Gordon said.
“It’s a nice way to hedge rather than taking off all those positions, paying short-term and long-term capital gains,” he said. “Hopefully the market holds the lows and moves up and I can just take that hedge off.”

Comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its December meeting next week. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.

“The market certainly — and this morning is another indication — is kind of looking past the [omicron] variant as something that’s going to be slowing down economic activity, but we’re still not completely out of the pandemic,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday.

This past Friday investors rotated out of tech stocks on those Covid-related fears, and into names linked to the recovering economy. Many market strategists and analysts have called this an overreaction but Erlam urged cautious optimism.
“Given the concern among global leaders and various organizations over the last couple of weeks, I struggle to see all of the updates being as positive which makes more two-way price action a strong possibility,” Erlam added. “A Santa rally may be underway but it will be a bumpy ride.”Stocks jumped for a second day, continuing their rebound from a recent rough patch, as investors grew less fearful of the potential economic impact from the new omicron coronavirus variant.

“Earnings have helped and a reminder that US reporting so far has been better than the long-term average in terms of beats,” Jim Reid, head of thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note. “It has still been healthier relative to some of the stagflationary gloom stories seen through September and early October which has perhaps helped the relief rally.”
Earnings season has seen some weak spots. Shares of Northrop Grumman and eBay closed lower on Thursday after disappointing quarterly reports.
The move for stocks came despite a disappointing economic report on Thursday. GDP growth for the third-quarter came in at 2.0%, below the 2.8% expected. The reading marks a slowdown from 6.7% growth in the second quarter.
However, the third-quarter report captured much of the delta wave of Covid-19 that rolled through the U.S. but has since receded, leading some to believe it was a short-term slowdown.
“The key to the 3Q GDP report for markets, however, does not appear to be the slower growth rate as much as the timing: last summer. Stock prices today are more focused on this winter (and even next summer) than they are on what happened last summer -- a well documented time early in the post-pandemic era,” Goldman Sachs managing director Chris Hussey said in a note to clients.
On a more positive note for the economy, weekly initial jobless claims came in at 281,000. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting 289,000 claims.
“I think we’re definitely back on track. We’ve seen the high frequency spending come in a lot more robust than we had expected,” said Andrew Smith, the chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors.
Wall Street was also monitoring events in Washington, where Democrats and President Joe Biden appear to have reached a deal on a $1.75 trillion social spending bill. Negotiations over the bill have held up a vote on a separate infrastructure package.

“Overall, the U.S. equities market maybe has 5% upside from these likes between now and the end of the year,” Kostin said. “Should we be going into a recession it will be meaningful downside, but that’s not the base case right now.”
— CNBC’s Patti Domm and Jeff Cox contributed reportingOfficials in recent days have tried to warn investors even faster policy tightening could be ahead. The findings, coupled with recent remarks from Fed Governor Lael Brainard and others, seemed to signal that sentiment.
Earlier Wednesday, Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said that he is “acutely concerned” about rising inflation, noting that he expects “a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve.”
His comments come less than a day after Brainard indicated support for higher interest rates and said a “rapid” reduction of the central bank’s balance sheet could come as soon as May. The remarks pushed stocks lower in the previous session.
“It is of paramount importance to get inflation down,” Brainard said during a Minneapolis Fed webinar. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly echoed similar sentiments toward inflation on Tuesday.
“What that means for the markets are continued volatility around the uncertainty to higher rates and lower-income cash flow stocks, growth type stocks probably continuing to get discounted as rates rise,” Cliff Corso of Advisors Asset Management said on CNBC’s “Worldwide Exchange.”Citi’s Chronert says a recession is near; shares his ‘top conviction calls’ to tough it out

End of interactive chart.Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield
jumped above 2.65% to a three-year high on Wednesday and remained near that high following the release of the Fed meeting minutes. The rate ended Monday at 2.40%. The minutes were from the Fed’s March meeting when it raised rates by a quarter point and indicated six more hikes of that magnitude were coming this year.
“I think the stock market is getting the idea that $60 billion Treasurys and $35 billion in mortgages is starting to get real,” said James Caron of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “If they do another 50 basis points hike in May and another 50 in June, it’s starting to get more real. It’s certainly not a tailwind for stocks.”Stocks fell for a second day on Wednesday and rates soared to new heights after the Federal Reserve gave more guidance on how fast it will tighten monetary policy to fight inflation, raising concerns it may slow the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 144.67 points, or 0.42%, to 34,496.51. The S&P 500 slid 0.97% to 4,481.15, and the Nasdaq Composite sank another 2.22% to 13,888.82 after falling about 2.3% on Tuesday.
“It was a warning to anyone who thinks that the Fed is going to be more dovish in their fight against inflation,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “Their message is, ‘You’re wrong.’”
The Fed’s release of its meeting minutes indicated on Wednesday afternoon that officials “generally agreed” it should shrink its balance sheet by $95 billion per month. The minutes also showed central bank officials were considering larger rate hikes than the usual 25-basis-point, or quarter-point, increments. Stocks dipped to session lows after the release of the minutes but bounced back slightly to end the day.
“Many participants noted that — with inflation well above the Committee’s objective, inflationary risks to the upside, and the federal funds rate well below participants’ estimates of its longer-run level — they would have preferred a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting,” the minutes said."

Oil prices slipped Tuesday, with West Texas Intermediate settling 1.28% lower at $101.96. Brent crude futures fell 0.83% to settle at $106.64. The market has been volatile since the onset of the war amid concerns over supply disruptions.
Tuesday’s moves come as investors await the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday. Those minutes come from last month’s meeting when the central bank hiked rates for the first time in years and indicated six more hikes were ahead this year.
Investors are preparing for the first-quarter corporate earnings season, which is set to begin next week.

End of interactive chart.Stocks fell on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard indicated the central bank could take a more aggressive approach to its tightening policy.
The Nasdaq Composite led Tuesday’s declines, shedding 2.26% to 14,204.17 and giving up its 1.9% pop in the prior session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 280.7 points, or 0.8%, closing at 34,641.18. The S&P 500 fell 1.26% to 4,525.12 after posting two straight days of gains.
“Ultimately, the way this is going to work, the economy is going to slow, the stock market has to reflect that,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics told CNBC’s “Power Lunch” on Tuesday. “So I do expect the stock market to have a tough few months here as it ultimately adjusts to what the Fed is doing and will do going forward.”
Tech stocks were among the biggest losers of the day. Chip stocks contributed to the decline, as Nvidia dropped 5.2% and AMD lost more than 3%. Some believe tech companies could be hurt the most by the Fed’s hiking campaign as investors take less risk and buy stocks with steady profits, rather than growth shares promising big earnings down the road.
Meanwhile, sectors like utilities and health care moved higher on Tuesday, with drugmakers Johnson & Johnson
and Pfizer
rising slightly along with staples like Procter & Gamble
and Walmart
. Cruise stocks Carnival
and Norwegian Cruise Line
added more than 2% and 1%, respectively.
“The way the market is acting today, the playbook is defense with commodities-linked sectors outperforming, while technology underperforms on the concern of high interest rates,” said Keith Lerner co-CIO and chief market strategist at Truist. “There’s concern about the economy and the Fed’s ability to maneuver a soft landing.”"

"S&P 500, Nasdaq eke out small gains as jump in Treasury yields cools",EST-20214:30-PM,"U.S. stocks pushed modestly higher on Wednesday as the recent jump in bond yields took a breather, allowing tech stocks to recover.
The S&P 500
ticked up 0.23% to close at 4,701.46, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
added 0.44% to finish at 15,845.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
lost just 9.42 points and settled at 35,804.38.
The recent rise in yields, which started around President Joe Biden’s decision to renominate Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, cooled slightly on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield has traded above 1.68% this week after ending Friday at 1.55%. However, the benchmark rate had dipped to about 1.64% on Wednesday afternoon.
Shares of Facebook-parent Meta
rose 1.1% to bolster the Nasdaq, while Roku
and Peloton
shook off rough starts to the week to rise more than 2% each. Computer hardware company HP
’s shares got a 10.1% lift after reporting earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines and issuing higher first-quarter earnings guidance.
The move in rates earlier this week sent investors fleeing from tech and growth shares, while boosting some bank stocks and energy shares. The divided market has left the Dow in the green for the week so far, the S&P 500 up just incrementally, and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.3%, even with Wednesday’s move.
“It’s certainly a story of more rotation,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The market is now — with the Powell renomination — thinking this is a reopening story, which sets aside any of the risks or concerns we might have about rising Covid infection rates.”
The meetings from the latest Fed meeting, released on Wednesday, showed that the central bankers were ready to accelerate the timetable for slowing asset purchases and raising the benchmark funds rate if inflation remains high. Stocks moved lower after the minutes were released.
The market did receive some bullish news on the economic front. Initial jobless claims for the prior week came in at 199,000, the lowest level in more than 50 years. GDP growth for the third quarter was revised up slightly to 2.1%, though economists expected it to rise to 2.2%. Personal income and consumer spending both rose more than expected in October.
The data was not uniformly positive, however, as durable goods orders showed an unexpected decline in October, according to the Census Bureau. Core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, was up 4.1% year over year for October, matching estimates.
Following those data releases, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker for fourth-quarter growth rose to 8.6% from 8.2%.
Earnings reports drove some of the biggest individual moves on Wednesday, as traditional retail stocks took a hit following poor quarterly results. Gap
lost 24% and Nordstrom
tumbled about 29%. Both companies reported earnings misses for the most recent quarter.
“A strong consumer and pent-up demand was supposed to make this a strong holiday season for retail, but margin and wage pressures are disrupting many retailer outlooks,” Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a note to clients.

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe Nasdaq Composite
fell for the second consecutive day as higher interest rates appeared to put pressure on high-flying tech stocks, but shares of banks and industrial names moved higher in a split market on Tuesday.
The tech-heavy index fell 0.50% to 15,775.14, while the S&P 500
ticked up 0.17% to close at 4,690.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
rose 194.55 points to 35,813.80 on the strength of bank and energy stocks.
The decline in tech and other growth stocks comes as Treasury yields have jumped following President Joe Biden’s decision to select Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a second term on Monday. Higher rates are often seen as a negative for high-growth companies because their future earnings look less attractive as short-term yields rise.
“We have seen a little pressure on tech stocks as long-term government bond yields have rallied for the second day now. That’s weighing on valuations. Zoom earnings didn’t help today, highlighting some of the dynamics in these very high-growth parts of the market that … growth is slowing on the margin,” said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Social media giant Meta
, the parent company of Facebook, fell 1.1%, while Roku
and biotech stock Moderna
dropped more than 2%. Shares of Zoom Video Communications
tumbled 14.7% a day after it beat earnings estimates but warned of a slowdown ahead as the Covid pandemic winds down and the demand for remote contact decreases
On the other hand, bank stocks rose along with rates, with shares of JPMorgan
adding nearly 2.4%.
Energy stocks climbed even after President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday that he would tap the strategic petroleum reserve in an attempt to lower gas prices at a time when inflation is running at its highest level in three decades. The price of oil had declined in recent days amid rumors that Biden would take this step but reversed higher on Tuesday.
Powell’s renomination was generally welcomed by Wall Street, but the moves in the Treasury market have been sharp. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was trading near 1.67% on Tuesday, up from about 1.54% on Friday. Yields move opposite of prices.
“With a Powell-led Fed, we expect the speed of the QE taper to follow the data, likely speeding up if inflation prints continue at the pace of the October print with interest rate hikes to shortly follow the taper (June at current pace). The market believes this action will keep the Fed in control of inflation,” Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager John Luke Tyner said in a note to clients.
“While the market is expecting a more hawkish response to current inflation, time will tell if it will be enough, as Powell is well established in the dovish camp of FOMC policy,” he added.
In other earnings news, shares of Best Buy
fell 12.3% after the company said comparable sales and gross profit margin might decline in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago period.

These underperformers could be the next to join the comeback rally, Jefferies saysInvestors also kept an eye on the bond market as the U.S. 5-year and 30-year Treasury yields inverted Monday for the first time since 2006, and the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate came close to inverting on Tuesday. Yield curve inversions are seen by some traders and economists as a recession indicator.
“The big talk right now is that at any given point in time, recession can be on the horizon,” Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, told CNBC. “Typically, you won’t see a recession for an average of 20 months once a yield curve inverts. Our antennas are up that recession risk is heightened; that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’ll be one this year, though next year is more of a concern for us.”
On Wednesday, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year held near 3 basis points, but regional bank stocks were under pressure. Shares of Zions Bancorp fell more than 3%, and Bank of New York Mellon shed 1.7%.
Wall Street was coming off strong two-week stretch, with the S&P 500 up roughly 10% since mid-March.
However, many investment professionals have been reluctant reluctant to call for the all-clear on a market rebound.
“Above 4,600 in the S&P 500, markets have now traded through most fundamental bounds of valuation, and for this rally to continue, we’ll need to see real, actual positive events (not just events that aren’t as bad as feared),” Tom Essaye of The Sevens Report said in a note to clients Wednesday.Crude prices, which have soared since the war in Ukraine began, climbed more than 3% to top $107 per barrel on Wednesday. Germany warned of potential rationing of natural gas due to disputes with Russia, and U.S. crude stockpiles fell.
The energy market swings appeared to drive action in equities on Wednesday. Oil stocks moved higher, with Valero rising roughly 4% and Phillips 66 gaining about 4.8%.
Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said the higher oil prices could be a bearish signal for the overall market even while it boosts energy stocks.
“We’re already seeing signs of what I call a countercyclical inflation environment, sometimes called a cost-push inflation environment, where inflation gets so high that it starts putting pressure” on growth, Sonders said.
Several retail stocks were under pressure on Wednesday after disappointing quarterly reports, including Five Below losing 6.5% and Chewy sliding 16%. RH fell 13% after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue came in short of expectations. On the positive side, apparel stock Lululemon jumped more than 9% after issuing upbeat guidance and announcing a share buyback program.
Semiconductor stocks were another weak spot for the market, with Marvell Technology falling 4.1% and Nvidia shedding more than 3%. Micron fell 3.5% despite a stronger-than-expected earnings report.
Elsewhere, shares of Apple, which had risen for 11 consecutive sessions, slipped about 0.7%.U.S. stocks slid on Wednesday, ending a winning streak for the market, as investors monitored developments in Ukraine and the bond market.
The S&P 500 fell 0.63% to 4,602.45, and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.21% to 14,442.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 65.38 points, or 0.19%, to 35,228.81. The Dow and S&P 500 each snapped a four-day stretch of gains."

However, the S&P 500 has now rebounded nearly 11% since March 14.
“It’s not quite lipstick on a pig but this move does take some of the sting off of what has been a weak Q1 for equities. ...

On the economic front, the conference board’s consumer confidence index came in at 107.2, below the 107.5 expected, according to Dow Jones. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed 11.3 million job openings, higher than the 11.1 million expected.Growing hope for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire appeared to help investor sentiment on Tuesday. Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin said Tuesday that the country will “drastically” reduce military activity near the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.
To be sure, both sides have said in recent days they are not close to reaching a deal. Ahead of the negotiations in Turkey, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on that “nothing is agreed upon unless everything is agreed upon.” Stocks gave back some of their gains on Tuesday after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was focused on Russia’s actions more than its words.

The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields, which economists see as more predictive of a potential recession, also narrowed perilously close to inversion on Tuesday. Some bond pricing sources said the curve did invert, but CNBC data showed that traded just about flat but did not technically invert.
Even when the yield curve correctly predicts a recession, it can still be more than year before the slowdown happens, history shows. Investors appeared to shake off the recession fears on Tuesday.
“Our base case is that the US economy can avoid a recession, lowering the threat of a sustained downtrend in stocks.

"Canadian satellite broadband company Telesat debuts on the Nasdaq, adding another space pure play",EST-20211:20-PM,"Telesat’s core growth project is the low Earth orbit broadband satellite network it’s building, called Lightspeed. Unlike the consumer focus of SpaceX’s Starlink constellation, Telesat plans to use its 298 Lightspeed satellites to provide high-speed fiber-like internet to business-to-business, or enterprise, customers around the world.
Goldberg emphasized that “Lightspeed is capital intensive,” with the company expecting it to cost $5 billion.
Telesat has lined up more than $3 billion in financing for Lightspeed so far, including a $1.1 billion investment from the Canadian government. The company will raise the remaining needed funding from export credit agencies, Goldberg said, with Telesat “in the process of finishing those discussions.”
The company launched an experimental low Earth orbit satellite in 2018, which Goldberg said was used for customer demonstrations and technology validation.
Telesat contracted French-Italian space hardware manufacturer Thales Alenia Space to build the satellites. The company does not yet have a specific target date for the first Lightspeed launches, with Goldberg noting that “Thales has had a few supply chain issues” that caused delays.Canadian satellite communications company Telesat
went public Friday on the Nasdaq, bringing another space pure-play stock to the market.
“We’re an established operator, with an established business, generating a significant amount of cash flow today with our existing customers, who were always quite forward thinking about where this market’s going,” Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg told CNBC.

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyMajor averages struggled to start Monday after a part of the Treasury yield curve briefly inverted overnight, raising some recession fears. The yield on the 5-year Treasury note
rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield
was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%. The spread ended the day negative, with the 30-year yielding below the 5-year for the first time since March 2006.
The main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
Bank stocks ticked lower on Monday as the yield curve flattened. JPMorgan
lost 0.7%, and Wells Fargo
fell 1.4%.
“With the backdrop of it being quarter-end this week and all the noise associated with that, stocks are hanging in there in the face of the rapid rise in interest rates across the yield curve,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
Investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine. Peace talks between the two nations are set to continue this week, with delegations from both countries traveling to Turkey on Monday. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that discussions were likely to resume Tuesday.
The Dow and S&P 500 closed out their second consecutive winning week on Friday, erasing more losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.
“Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. The S&P 500 rose on Monday, extending two weeks of gains, as investors shook off recession concerns and bid tech shares higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 94.65 points to 34,955.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.7% to 4,575.52. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 1.3% to 14,354.90, thanks to a 8% jump in Tesla. The S&P 500 hit its high of the session as crude oil hit its low of the day, down more than 11%.
Oil prices fell on Monday following their recent surge due to the geopolitical conflict. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures
 slid about 7% to settle at $105.96. Brent crude futures
 settled nearly 7% lower at $112.48 per barrel.
Energy stocks slid alongside the price of oil. Chevron

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyHowever, interest rates already moved sharply higher in the first week of 2022, sparking a sell-off in tech stocks. That suggests the hot inflation report, and future tightening by the Federal Reserve, may be at least partially priced in to the market.
“We’ve been saying for a while that we didn’t expect the peak in one-year inflation numbers until early 2022 and further supply chain disruptions from the omicron variant strengthen that case. But the more important question right now is the exact timing of when inflation might start to slow, since ultimately that will likely determine how aggressive the Federal Reserve ... will be,” LPL Financial asset allocation strategist Barry Gilbert said in a note.
Stocks tied to economic growth were some of the stronger performers, with chemical company Mosaic

Wednesday’s moves continued a bounce-back week for equities, with tech stocks in particular clawing back sharp losses from the first week of the year that were accompanied by a jump in interest rates. Last week’s decline brought parts of the market close to key technical levels closely watched by Wall Street pros.
“The Nasdaq went down and bounced off of the moving 200-day moving average on Monday, and that’s kind of been where this rally sort of began,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.U.S. stocks moved slightly higher Wednesday after a key inflation report showed a historic gain but largely matched expectations.
The S&P 500 added roughly 0.28% to 4,726.35, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.23% to 15,188.39 for its third straight positive day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shuffled between modest gains and losses through the session, finished with a gain of 38.3 points, or 0.11%, at 36,290.32.
The moves come after the December reading for the consumer price index, a gauge of prices across a broad spectrum of goods, showed a gain of 7% year over year. That is the biggest jump since 1982, but was in line with expectations from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The monthly increase was slightly hotter than expected."

Officials discussed reducing the Fed’s balance sheet in another move to dial back its pandemic-era easy monetary policy.
As investors digested the minutes Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield pushed as high as above 1.75%, after ending last year at 1.51%.
Regional banks Fifth Third and Regions rose more than 4%. Shares of Citi rose 3.2%, and Wells Fargo and Bank of America both added more than 2%.
Energy shares helped boost the market as crude prices rose. Diamondback Energy climbed 4.6%, Devon Energy added 3.7%, and Occidental gained nearly 3%.
The Fed’s plan to reduce the number of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities it holds comes as the central bank is already tapering its bond purchases and is set to hike interest rates after the taper concludes.
“There are a lot of newer investors in the market that have never seen a rate hike cycle,” Young said. “If you look throughout history it’s not a death sentence for the market, it’s not a death sentence for tech overall. Historically, the first rate hike – which is what I think everybody got scared of yesterday – it’s not that detrimental to equities either.”Stocks fell on Thursday to end a day of choppy trading, following the massive tech sell-off in the previous session.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 170.64 points, or 0.4%, to 36,236.47. The S&P 500 lost 0.1%, closing at 4,696.05. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1% to 15,080.86. The Nasdaq fell about 4% over the previous two trading sessions.

“Investors are trying to wrap their heads around what different leadership looks like: we’ve all been conditioned that tech is the winner all day every day and that is just not going to be the case this year,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “Finishing out 2021, there were still a lot of investors who were overweight tech.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comCNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he sees a handful of attractively priced technology stocks following a rough start to 2022 for the broad cohort and suggested investors look to take advantage of the weakness.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
is down about 3.5% for 2022 after just three trading days, and “you have to pick among the rubble when it does that,” the “Mad Money” host said.
Cramer offered up the following stocks to consider: Enterprise software giant Salesforce
, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms
, cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks
and chipmaker Nvidia
. All four stocks are in the red for 2022 and notably down from their respective all-time highs, Cramer said.
“I always hear from people complaining that ... they bought these high-quality tech stocks when they were flying. You’re certainly not buying them at the high today if you bought them, certainly not tomorrow if we go again,” Cramer said.
“Even though they might be clobbered again tomorrow, you’ve got to pick your spot here. You can’t act as if this was their first day down,” he added.
Cramer stressed that he was not encouraging investors to look at buying unprofitable technology companies that trade on price-to-sales ratios. He’s been advising viewers to avoid those types of stocks for weeks, while instead championing companies with “real earnings.”
“I’m getting more enticed by the profitable tech names that just got beheaded. Price does matter to me,” Cramer said.

Rivian debuts on the Nasdaq — Here’s what four pros are saying about the company now,EST-20217:58-AM,"Electric-truck maker Rivian
went public Wednesday on the Nasdaq, opening at $106.75 per share after being priced at $78.
Four experts discuss what’s next for the company.
Duncan Davidson, partner at Bullpen Capital, shares one major headwind for the company.
“If you look at how these things are priced, they’re like 10 to 20 times sales. Next year Rivian’s supposed to have run $8 billion in sales, so this actually means this pricing is not out of whack if they actually hit their production. That’s the Achilles’ heel. Tesla
has had real difficulty scaling up over the years, and they had much more time than Rivian had to do it. But I think we’re going to solve this problem pretty quickly. Look at the whole car industry. They’re having problems with production now anyway because of chips and other friction in the supply chain.”
Pete Najarian, co-founder of MarketRebellion.com, highlights its high-profile backers.
“I think what really excites me about this is Ford
does have the investment. I think it’s interesting that they decided to just do the investment and not use the technology. That’s a little bit odd to me. But I still think obviously they sure made a great decision back in 2019. Now I’m looking at Amazon
as well ... a 20% stake, and they’re actually one of the folks that absolutely is part of this whole flow of orders and the 100,000 for these delivery vans. I think this is a great backstop, in my opinion, is the fact that Amazon has this investment. They’ve got their 20%. I don’t assume by any stretch that Amazon has any kind of plans to get rid of that, so I think because of that, that’s always going to be there, and who knows how that’s going to play out over the next multiple years.”
Venture capital reporter Eric Newcomer lays out one challenge for Rivian.
“It’s a company that is producing cars that hasn’t delivered many of them, promised like 1,000 this year, is waffling between whether it will generate zero or $1 million in revenue this year. It’s a company that’s losses are going to have to accelerate. Yes, it’s going to raise a ton of money in this IPO given the pricing, but the amount of money the car companies spend is enormous. So building up the kind of scale requires excellent execution. There are lots of businesses where you can get really sucked into the story. But the problem with car companies is they have to deliver quarter after quarter on a fundamentally low-margin business that requires a lot of operational excellence, some of which you just have to learn over time even if you’re the smartest new car company around. It just takes time to figure out the process, learn from your mistakes and deliver.”
Dan Nathan, principal at Risk Reversal, discusses the valuation.
“It says so much about the market that we’re in, in the stock market and crypto markets, that you could be anointed at the opening today [with a] $100 billion market cap essentially pre-revenue. I mean, listen, if you think about what the total addressable market is for EVs, you could say, ‘Alright, well maybe we just fast-forwarded a little bit, we got rid of those first five years’ ... the fits and the starts and all the palpitations of that, and that’s what the market is saying. I don’t blame the bankers and I don’t blame the company. This one is on investors. The first indication on price was somewhere around $50 ... It’s investors that are clamoring for this.”

While the fast spread of the omicron variant has been reflected in case numbers, data shows it hasn’t led to a major increase in hospitalizations, and investor appetite for vaccine makers has been subdued. They were among the biggest decliners Monday, with Moderna and BioNTech down about 7.4% and 10%, respectively. Pfizer fell 4%.

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyStocks climbed even after the Kremlin reportedly dismissed news of progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks. According to Bloomberg News, a Kremlin spokesman those reports were “wrong.” The Financial Times reported Wednesday that both countries had made “significant progress” on a peace plan and Russian withdrawal from Ukraine.
Thursday marked a key day for Russia to pay coupons on its sovereign bonds, which were due on Wednesday, to avoid default. Reuters, citing a source familiar with the situation, reported on Thursday that Russia made two payments in dollars and that the money would soon be distributed to bondholders.
Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, noted the S&P 500 gained after the Reuters report was released.
He added, however, that there are “still a lot of questions about the payments. To what extent do they make payments in dollar bonds instead of rubles? … I don’t know what this means for all of their payments.”
The debt market drama comes as Russia has largely been cut out of the global financial system as a result of its war in Ukraine. In order to avoid default, Russia needed to make the payments in dollars and not the rapidly weakening ruble, and it was unclear if foreign banks would process the payments or allow Russia to access its accounts.Loading chart...Stocks jumped for a third straight day on Thursday, building on a strong rally this week, as investors digested the latest news out of Ukraine and got comfortable with the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting.

The moves come after a massive two-day rally for stocks. The S&P 500 jumped more than 3% in the previous two sessions, while the Dow posted back-to-back surges of more than 500 points. The blue-chip index is on pace for its first positive week in six.
“We’re on day three of potential gains here, and a lot of investors are going in thinking maybe there are calmer waters,” Jeff Kilburg, chief investment office of Sanctuary Wealth, said Thursday afternoon. “The Fed meeting ended up being a non-event, getting past it was a big mental component for the marketplace. As we start to get past it and realize uncertainty in the Russia-Ukraine situation feeds into their formula, it puts a short-term bullish sentiment in the market.

GitLab jumps 35% in its Nasdaq debut after code-sharing company priced IPO above expected range,EDT-20214:13-PM,"GitLab raised close to $650 million in the offering, and investors purchased over $150 million of additional stock from an entity affiliated with GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij.
GitLab offers a free version of what the company calls its DevOps platform, a term referencing the combination of developers and IT operations. The software allows users to work on code, package it, release it and monitor it. Customers can run GitLab in any public cloud, their own data center or as a GitLab-hosted service.
The company makes money from its premium products. For $19 a month per user, GitLab includes tools for enterprises and faster code reviews, and for $99 a month, users get features like security and compliance. Some 383 customers are spending at least $100,000 a year, GitLab said in its prospectus.
“Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to convert users of our free product offering into paying customers by selling additional products, and by upselling additional subscription services,” GitLab said.
GitLab said its net revenue retention rate, a key metric for subscription software companies because it shows customer success, climbed to 152% in the July period. That would put it among the top publicly traded software companies.
It’s also the main reason, along with GitLab’s growth, that the company is commanding such a high revenue multiple. At a $14.9 billion market cap, GitLab trades for about 64 times annualized revenue, below only three of the 58 companies in the Bessemer Cloud Index, and above Atlassian.
GitLab is widely known as a pioneer in remote work. While companies were forced to adapt to distributed work during the pandemic, GitLab started that way and didn’t have to alter much of anything for its 1,350 employees operating in more than 65 countries. In the header of its prospectus, Gitlab says “address not applicable.”
GitLab, which was founded in 2012 and incorporated two years later, was last valued at $6 billion in a secondary financing, confirmed in early 2021, that allowed existing shareholders to sell up to 20% of their vested equity. That was up from a $2.7 billion valuation in a late 2019 financing round.
In its “team handbook” on its website, GitLab had openly stated its plan to go public by November 2020. After the pandemic hit early last year, roiling the broader economy, the company scrapped the timing for its debut while indicating that a public listing was still on the roadmap.
GitLab co-founder Sijbrandij is the company’s largest stakeholder, with 19% ownership before the offering, according to the prospectus. Khosla Ventures owns 14%, followed by ICONIQ at about 12%, August Capital at 11% and GV (formerly Google Ventures) at just under 7%.
WATCH: The rise of open source softwareGitLab shares jumped 35% in their first day of trading on Thursday after the provider of software for developer collaboration sold shares well above its expected range in its IPO.
Trading on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol “GTLB,” GitLab priced its stock at $77 late Wednesday, valuing the company at about $11 billion. GitLab had said it would likely sell shares at $66 to $69 each. The stock opened closed at $103.89, pushing GitLab’s market cap to $14.9 billion

Top analyst cuts Tesla price target while projecting it will ‘widen its lead’ in EVsSolid Power’s batteries differ than the ones currently being used for many EVs, including Teslas
. The company makes so-called solid-state batteries, which don’t use the liquid electrolyte found in the conventional lithium-ion batteries currently used to power most electric vehicles.
Solid-state batteries can be safer and lighter, with greater energy density that provides more range at a lower cost. But they are currently more costly than lithium-ion batteries and early in development.
Campbell said the company’s solid-state batteries can be produced in a similar manner as lithium-ion batteries, allowing automakers who are investing billions in those battery cells to easily transition to solid-state batteries.Shares of electric vehicle battery cell supplier Solid Power
surged as much as 14% during the company’s Nasdaq debut Thursday morning following the completion of a SPAC deal.
The stock’s initial performance is similar to other electric vehicle related companies that have gone public through deals with blank-check companies. Many jump during initial trading to then level-off and become volatile over time.
Solid Power, whose investors include Ford Motor
and BMW
, is trading under the ticker symbol “SLDP.” Its warrants are trading under “SLDPW.” The stock was as high as $14.85 a share before retreating to under $14 , up by less than 6%. Its warrants were up by about 38% during midday trading Thursday.
Solid Power CEO Doug Campbell told CNBC that he’s not worried about the short-term performance of the stock, including any volatility similar to previous SPAC-backed companies. He said the $542.9 million from the company’s deal to go public should fund the business until its first commercial launch with an automaker in 2026.
“We’re focused on developing and commercializing a viable product. So, in my opinion, what the stock does over the next six months or 12 months is kind of meaningless as it pertains to getting our product into the marketplace,” he said during an interview ahead of the company’s listing. “Ultimately, that’s when we plant the flag of success.”Shares of electric vehicle battery cell supplier Solid Power Inc. surged during their debut Thursday morning on the Nasdaq following the company completing a SPAC deal to bring it public.

"S&P 500, Nasdaq break 3-day win streak as investors turn their attention to key inflation data",EST-20218:27-PM,"That, in turn, poses risks that the Federal Reserve will move more quickly than already anticipated. Fed officials are expected to react to the burst in inflation by announcing next week that the central bank will begin pulling back on its economic aid.
The first step will be accelerating the reduction in the central bank’s monthly bond purchases, with markets expecting the Fed to double the taper to $30 billion. That could pave the way for interest rate hikes as soon as the spring of 2022 and mark the latest Fed policy pivot under Chairman Jerome Powell.
“Another upside surprise to core inflation just ahead of the December meeting would likely add further conviction to a Fed that has recently become seemingly more focused on the price stability side of its mandate,” Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote. A stronger than expected print “could create an even greater sense of urgency for the Fed to react to high inflation through possibly earlier rate hikes.”

Goldman Sachs reveals 7 under-the-radar global stocks to buy this year
Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyStill, there were some positive moves. CVS gained 4.5% after it issued upbeat guidance ahead of its investor day. Home-furnishings retailer RH rose about 5.4% after it reported blowout earnings and lifted the low end of its revenue outlook.
The moves come a day ahead of important inflation news. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the consumer price index for November. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the year-over-year growth rate to be 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
Markets already are expecting a high inflation reading, with some economists projecting the possibility that the headline number including food and energy could exceed 7%.Several travel-related stocks, which led the market higher throughout the week, were lower Thursday. Shares of Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line dipped about 1.6%. United Airlines was 1.7% lower. Travel booking stocks Expedia and Booking Holdings lost 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively. The Invesco Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment ETF fell 1.2%. All are still on track to end the week higher, however.
Separately, shares of American Airlines fell 0.4% after the company said it’s reducing its schedule due to the fact that it’s still awaiting Boeing Dreamliner deliveries. Shares of Boeing slid 1.6%.
Rent The Runway shares tumbled by 4.1% after reporting swelling losses and lower than pre-pandemic subscriber growth for its most recent quarter. Electric vehicle maker Lucid saw shares fall 18.3% after the company announced a proposed $1.75 billion offering of convertible senior notes.Loading chart...The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished lower on Thursday after all three of the major averages posted three straight days of gains. Traders took a pause from the rebound rally and turned their attention to inflation data due out on Friday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the trading session at 35,754.69, losing less than a point. The S&P 500 fell 0.72% to 4,667.45 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.7% to 15,517.37. All the major averages are still on track for a winning week.
Stocks gave back some of their gains from recent days, with the moves higher spurred by the belief that the omicron variant of Covid looks less severe than earlier forms.
“We think Covid is still the investor narrative,” said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer of AXS Investments. “So we think investors are not only taking a breather, but a lot of eyes are shifting to economic data to gauge where the Fed might be going in terms of potentially faster and greater extent of tapering.”"
Roughly half of the Nasdaq 100 is below this critical longer-term trend line. Here’s what’s next,EDT-20211:05-PM,"A painful month for high-growth stocks has punished the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100
.
Bond yields have risen on higher inflation expectations over that stretch — high-growth stocks such as technology often fall during these times as their valuations are harder to justify.
The QQQ Nasdaq 100 ETF
, which holds stocks such as Apple
and Microsoft
, has fallen 7% since an early September high. Roughly half of the ETF’s stocks now trade below their 200-day moving average, a critical longer-term trend line.
“I definitely was one of the people sounding the alarm about stretched valuations,” Gina Sanchez, chief market strategist at Lido Advisors, told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday.
“The reason that a lot of people really weren’t that concerned about technology was because technology had a good story going into the pandemic and then the pandemic gave it some rocket fuel and so then it did really well,” she said.
The QQQ ETF rallied nearly 50% in 2020, buoyed during the initial stretch of the pandemic by a reliance on technology — those gains well surpassed the 16% gain for the S&P 500
. The QQQ ETF peaked at more than 32 times forward earnings in September 2020.
“Now here’s the problem. As the rest of the economy has opened up, tech and communications just haven’t had the same play, and that’s 70% of the QQQs. And if you look all year as the reopening has occurred the QQQs have lagged the S&P 500, and that’s just because there are other places right now to play the reopening,” Sanchez said.
She says it’s not “dead money” but will likely lag as investors search for better opportunities with “more reasonable and more sustainable” valuations.
Todd Gordon, founder of Inside Edge Capital Management, sees this as the typical cycle that impacts growth stocks when interest rates move up.
“But, don’t make this mistake, we’re still seeing growth outpace on relative strength. If you take that center S&P as the benchmark, growth is still in the last two months outperforming value,” Gordon said during the same interview.
The IVW growth ETF
, which holds stocks with a premium valuation, has risen 16% this year. The IVE value ETF
, by comparison, is up 14% — these stocks are considered cheap relative to the rest of the market.
Growth has fallen more than value in the past month, though. Gordon adds that he predicts a rotation back into growth stocks after that recent decline.

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe new drug from Merck appeared to boost travel stocks. Shares of Royal Caribbean and Las Vegas Sands added 3.8% and 4.3%, respectively. Southwest Airlines rose 5.6% after JPMorgan upgraded the stock and said most of the group was worth buying for a trade. Bank stocks rose as well, helping the Dow outperform.
“We have seen this rotation back to the so-called reopening plays and the more cyclical areas, which I think makes a lot of sense over the next couple of weeks as we think about the Covid trends improving, with the cases falling from last month’s peak, and the news about the Merck pill appears promising,” said Angelo Kourkafas, an investment strategist at Edward Jones.
Vaccine stocks, including Moderna, pulled back following the Merck news.
Friday’s market rebound came after Wall Street capped a tumultuous September as inflation fears, slowing growth and rising rates kept investors on edge. The S&P 500 finished the month down 4.8%, breaking a seven-month winning streak. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively, suffering their worst months of the year.
“A combination of slowing growth, less accommodative monetary policy, China headwinds, fading fiscal stimulus, and nagging supply chain bottlenecks all conspired to weigh on investor sentiment as we head into fall and 4Q21,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
Ten of the 11 S&P 500 sectors suffered losses in September, led to the downside by a 7.4% monthly drop in materials stocks. Energy is the best performer of the month, gaining more than 9%.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell back below 1.50% on Friday. A jump in rates to end September knocked tech stocks.
The S&P ended Thursday 5.2% below its all-time high reached in early September, the first 5% pullback of 2021. Even with Friday’s rally, the index fell 2.2% for the week. The Dow and Nasdaq lost close to 1.4% and 3.2%, respectively.
The S&P 500 is still up roughly 16% on the year, however.
“That’s just a squiggle. As we zoom out, it’s going to look like nothing in 12 months. I know investors are nervous, and there’s a lot of headwinds here, but as you know, when the wall of worry is big, that’s often a good opportunity for investors,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee said on CNBC’s “Halftime Report.”U.S. stocks pushed higher on Friday as investors shook off a rough September and news of a new oral treatment for Covid-19 boosted shares of companies tied to the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 482.54 points, or 1.43%, to close at 34,326.46. The S&P 500 rose nearly 1.2% to 4,357.04, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8% to 14,566.70 and snapped a five-day losing streak.
Shares of Dow member Merck jumped close to 8.4% after the drug maker and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said their oral antiviral treatment for Covid-19 reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% for patients with mild or moderate cases. The companies plan to seek emergency authorization for the treatment."

The “Mad Money” host has said he sees this rotation out of technology stocks as largely a result of investors taking profits in winning positions and deploying profits in parts of the market that have lagged.
But it won’t last forever, Cramer said Tuesday while pointing viewers toward a cohort of tech stocks he believes will be the first to bottom. He called this group the “red hots” and said it’s the leading place to look for buying opportunities in that industry.
“These are companies that did absolutely nothing wrong. ... They reported better-than-expected results top and bottom, forecasted higher growth, yet their stocks are still getting crushed this week,” Cramer said, ticking off the following firms: Alphabet
, Microsoft
, Cloudflare
, Palo Alto Networks
, Roblox

"Nasdaq dips 1% as bond yields rise, tech falters after Biden picks Powell for second Fed term",EST-20217:41-PM,"The central bank has said it would begin slowing its asset purchases in November, its first major scaling back of its emergency programs from 2020, and indicated that it could accelerate that process early next year.
Brainard, who was seen as Powell’s main competition and was favored by progressives in Washington for her stances on bank regulation and climate change, is being nominated for a vice chair position at the central bank but not to the top regulatory role many had expected.
Powell, a Republican, was first nominated to the Fed board of governors a decade ago by President Barack Obama and ascended to the top job under President Donald Trump. His ties to the Republican Party and previous confirmation for the Fed’s top job were seen by some as reasons that he could be easier to confirm in a closely divided Senate than another candidate.
“I think this is a decent 1-2 combination,” UBS director of floor operations Art Cashin said on “Squawk on the Street.” “I think that’s what they wanted to get, no disruption. I think the market reaction you’re seeing is the market is happy with no disruption.”
Outside of the bank stocks, Moderna
was another bright spot for the market. Shares of the biotech firm continued their upward momentum, rising 7.1% after the FDA last week cleared the company’s booster shot for all U.S. adults.

shed 5.6%.
Covid news also weighed on market sentiment, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the country was seeing a spike of the virus.
The final weeks of the year tend to be a strong seasonal period for Wall Street. Stocks have a track record of posting gains in Thanksgiving week, which will potentially set the stage for a year-end Santa rally.

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe move to reappoint Powell assuaged investors worried about switching central bank chiefs while the country’s economy is trying to emerge from the Covid pandemic and battle inflation levels not seen in three decades.
“Continuity will be key during this potentially tricky phase of the recovery where inflation is elevated and sticky, demand growth is strong but cooling, and capital and labor supply is gradually rebounding,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
Powell’s renomination comes as inflation has exceeded expectations in recent months, leading the Fed to walk back its predictions that the rise in prices that accompanied the reopening of the economy would be “transitory.” Some critics have said the Fed is waiting too long to tighten monetary policy.Stocks slumped Monday afternoon, reversing an earlier rally that came after President Joe Biden announced he would nominate Chairman Jerome Powell to continue to lead the Federal Reserve, rather than nominating Fed governor Lael Brainard for the post.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 17.27 points to close at 35,619.25, down from a gain of more than 300 points at session highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.32% to 4,682.94 and 1.26% to 15,854.76, respectively, after setting intraday record highs.
Bank stocks and Treasury yields moved higher after the White House announced the Fed decision. Shares of JPMorgan rose 2.1%, while Morgan Stanley rose nearly 2.5%. The move higher in rates appeared to take a bite out of some tech stocks, whose future earnings are less attractive to investors when yields are higher.
“I think the drivers on today’s action is more technical, short-week, rotational, dollar strength and interest rates up a little bit,” said David Waddell, chief investment strategist at Waddell and Associates. “I don’t know how much of the reaction today is Powell-specific, but I think Powell overall is positive.”
Powell, a former private equity executive, slashed interest rates to near zero and implemented emergency asset purchases in March 2020 to help backstop the market during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, helping the financial system to remain operational during a sharp slowdown in economic activity. He also led a landmark reevaluation of the Fed’s inflation targeting framework during the Covid crisis."
"Dow drops 500 points, Nasdaq sinks more than 2% on fears of a Russian attack on Ukraine",EST-20229:56-PM,"This week’s volatility in the bond market started after a hotter-than-expected inflation reading on Thursday, which prompted St. Louis Fed President James Bullard to call for accelerating rate hikes — a full percentage point increase by the start of July.
However, Fed officials contacted by CNBC’s Steve Liesman said that they don’t expect a 50-basis-point move in March would be appropriate. A basis point is equal to 0.01%, and the Fed typically moves rates up in 25-basis-point increments. The presidents of the Atlanta, Richmond and San Francisco Feds pushed back against the idea of a double hike.
Goldman Sachs shifted its expectations for the Fed this year, calling for seven rate hikes in an effort to cool an economy that has generated inflation far more persistent than policymakers had anticipated.
“The Fed is obviously behind the curve ... It’s going to have to raise rates more than the market still thinks,” DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said Friday on CNBC’s “Halftime Report.” “My suspicion is they are going to keep raising rates until something breaks, which always happens.”

Energy stocks moves higher alongside the price of oil, with Diamondback Energy rising nearly 4% and Devon Energy adding 3.6%. Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips gained 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively.Stocks moved sharply lower in afternoon trading after a jump in oil prices that appeared to be tied to increased concerns about Russia taking military action against Ukraine.
With about 2 hours left to the trading day, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said at a White House briefing that there were signs of Russian escalation at the Ukraine border and that it was possible that an invasion could take place during the Olympics, despite speculation to the contrary.
Both the U.S. and U.K. have called for their citizens to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.
Sullivan noted that the U.S. is not certain that Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a final decision to invade Ukraine. But “it may well happen soon,” he said.

Shares of Hertz fall 9.8% on first day of Nasdaq relisting,EST-20214:31-PM,"It’s unclear the status of Hertz’s deal with Tesla, after CEO Elon Musk last week said no agreement had been signed. Hertz has declined to directly comment on the deal, citing its plans remain on track.  
Hertz Vice Chair Tom Wagner, of Knighthead Capital Management, dodged answering questions Tuesday about the status of the Tesla order as well as whether it will be paying full price for the vehicles, which Musk has said Hertz would do.
“We’ll work with Tesla and other OEMs to bring EVs into the fleet in a way that works for the OEMs, in a way that works for Hertz,” Wagner said during the “Squawk Box” interview alongside Fields and Hertz Chair Gregory O’Hara, of Certares Management. 
During the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection — but as travel rebounded somewhat and demand for rental vehicles picked up, investors from Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management said they would take over the company.
Knighthead, Certares and Apollo own 42% of Hertz, according to Bloomberg.Since October 2020, Hertz’s common stock has traded on the over-the-counter market under the symbol HTZZ, following its Chapter 11 filing in May 2020. The company after emerging from bankruptcy had previously applied to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “HTZ.”
The company’s outstanding warrants also were listed Tuesday on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “HTZWW.” The publicly-listed warrants declined Tuesday by 18.5% to $16.95 a share.
Hertz said Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were acting as lead bookrunning managers for the proposed offering, which is expected to close Friday.
The public offering and repurchase plan follow a runup in the company’s shares after it announced former Ford CEO Mark Fields as its interim chief executive and a plan to add 100,000 Tesla cars to its fleet through 2022.
“This is not only about running an excellent rental car company, we’re gonna stay very focused on that, but this is also about a transformation of Hertz,” Fields said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”After emerging from bankruptcy protection in June, the parent company for Hertz rental cars made its trading debut on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, falling by 9.8% to $26.17 a share.

The shares were offered by a group of shareholders, including Cougar Capital and Oaktree Capital Management, which raised $1.3 billion under the new terms, according to a public filing.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq notch record closes as jobless claims reach pandemic low,EDT-20214:14-PM,"The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed to new respective records on Thursday after weekly U.S. jobless claims reached their lowest level since the start of the Covid crisis.
The broad equity benchmark added 0.3% to 4,536.95, hitting its 54th record closing high of 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.29 points, or 0.4%, to 35,443.82, lifted by Walgreens and Chevron. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.1% to 15,331.18, also reaching a record close.
First-time claims for unemployment insurance totaled 340,000 for the week ended Aug. 28, versus a Dow Jones estimate of 345,000. The number is also the lowest since March 2020.
The data came in a day before the key August jobs report, which investors are watching closely to decipher how fast the Federal Reserve will remove easy monetary policy. Economists predict 720,000 jobs were added in the month, down from 943,000 jobs added in July.
“With jobless claims hitting a pandemic low, there’s definitely some optimism as we look ahead to the full jobs picture tomorrow,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade. “We could experience a bit of a tug and a pull — on one hand a solid jobs report is a positive indication of economic recovery, and on the other it backs up the Fed’s case to begin tapering.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has emphasized the need for more strong jobs data before the central bank would start to unwind its massive bond-buying program, putting heightened focus on Friday’s employment report.
On Thursday, Chewy and Five Below were among the notable movers with shares tumbling 9.3% and 13%, respectively, after reporting quarterly results. Shares of ChargePoint, the maker of charge systems for electric vehicles, jumped 8.2% after reporting stellar quarterly earnings.

On the economic data front, U.S. jobless claims came in at 238,000 for the week ending Jan. 29, the Labor Department reported Thursday, slightly fewer than expected.
Those numbers followed the release of ADP’s surprisingly downbeat private payrolls data Wednesday. Investors are still looking forward to Friday’s release of nonfarm payrolls data. Consensus estimates see a gain of 150,000 jobs, according to Dow Jones, but Wall Street forecasters say the actual tally will be far lower, with one estimating a loss of 400,000 jobs in January.

Alpha is back with most hedge funds outperforming in January, Bank of America says
Retail investors are buying the January dip in force, especially these four stocks
The struggles now for Facebook are similar to 2018, so analysts think the stock should bounce backOther social media names followed Meta lower on Thursday. Snap shares slid 23.6%, and Twitter dropped 5.5%.
Thursday’s declines come after the major averages notched a four-day win streak during the regular session Wednesday, led by Google-parent Alphabet. Investors bought the dip in tech stocks after shedding their positions throughout January as they braced for potential rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
Strong earnings from Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet drove investors back into tech, reminding them that fundamentals are still strong, but Meta Platforms’ weak guidance has caused some to reverse course.
“The problem we’re suffering from right now for earnings in general is it’s not enough to have good earnings, you have to lay out a really good plan going forward with a lot of optimism. ‘Good isn’t good enough’ is really the theme of this earnings season so far,” Kinahan said.
That heightened bar, Kinahan added, is due in part to the forthcoming Fed rate hikes. This week, tech earnings distracted investors from the central bank’s upcoming moves, but the prospect of policy tightening is still driving the market, he said.
“All assets have a different value than they did,” Kinahan said. “You have this wide range of assumed rate hikes and you’re trying to reprice all these assets based on that assumption, taking into account what they’re saying for future earnings.”
“In the past, if you bought a dip you’d be fine,” he added. “Now, it’s a little bit more of ‘well show me that if I buy the dip, I can be okay.’”
Spotify fell 16.7% after the company’s latest quarterly figures showed a slowdown in premium subscriber growth. Pinterest and Amazon, which will both report earnings after the closing bell, fell 10.3% and 7.8%, respectively.
“We could get another opportunity this afternoon to change the narrative once more,” Kinahan said, noting that investors are expecting Amazon to show record quarterly earnings and revenue.
Outside of tech, Dow component Honeywell’s shares fell 7.6% after the company beat narrowly on profit but fell short on revenue and provided lower-than-expected guidance.Loading chart...U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as investors’ renewed optimism on big tech names, driven by a slew of strong earnings, took a turn down after Facebook-parent Meta Platforms reported disappointing quarterly results.
Losses deepened by the afternoon, with the Nasdaq Composite falling 3.7% to 13,878.82 for its worst day since September 2020. The S&P 500 had its worst day in nearly a year, sliding 2.4% to 4,477.44, with tech shares as the biggest drag. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 518.17 points, or 1.4%, to 35,111.16.
“Facebook is a confidence builder,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It’s a super widely held stock and a core part of many portfolios, so when it has such a difficult time, it just shakes overall confidence. The question right now is, is this a Meta-specific issue, or is this going to be an overall issue?”
Meta Platforms shares plunged 26.4% after the company’s quarterly profit fell short of expectations. The company also issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter. It was the biggest drop ever for the Facebook parent."
"S&P 500, Nasdaq close at record highs as Wall Street looks for strong finish to August",EDT-20214:34-PM,"“With record GDP and earnings growth, rising inflation and the rates of infection from the Delta variant peaking, the Fed will feel more pressure to remove what is essentially emergency monetary accommodation,” wrote Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, who sees a 10% correction soon in the market. “We expect a more formal signal from the Fed at the September FOMC meeting, and the markets are likely to anticipate it. That means higher interest rates and lower equity valuations.”
Stocks could stay largely range-bound until the release of August’s jobs report on Friday. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 750,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%.
With the Fed’s Jackson Hole meeting in the rearview, investors are now focused on the direction of stocks for the final months of the year. The S&P 500 is up more than 20% in 2021 but the market is also absorbing peak policy stimulus, peak earnings acceleration and peak reopening momentum.
However, a slowdown in earnings and economic growth could still be a positive environment for stocks.
“Even with a mild cool-off in economic activity, the earnings profile is unequivocally strong. Even with a degree of moderation of these sky-high levels, they will still be high enough to present a conducive environment for equities. In other words, a tone down from great settings to good,” researchers from Bank of America said in a note to clients.

Monday and Tuesday mark the last two trading days of August. After Monday’s session, the S&P 500 is up 3% in August, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite have risen 1.3% and 4% this month, respectively. The strong month came as corporate earnings reports for the second quarter showed strong growth for sales and profits.
“We can’t entirely dismiss the risks, including the Delta variant, supply chain disruptions, and inflation pressures—particularly wages. But we expect corporate America’s efficiency and the strength of the reopening to continue to power earnings ahead and lead to additional gains for stocks over the rest of 2021,” Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, said in a note to clients on Monday.
Stocks appeared to get another boost last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled on Friday that bond tapering could start this year, but the central bank is in no rush to hike interest rates. 
Based on statements from other Fed officials, a tapering announcement could come as soon as the Fed’s Sept. 21-22 meeting. Powell said the central bank has “much ground to cover” to reach its other goal of maximum employment.The S&P 500 set another record high on Monday as the stock market continued to rise in the final days of August.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq close at records – Three investors share what they’re watching,EDT-20216:04-PM,"Stocks rallied again on Wednesday with the S&P 500
and Nasdaq
both hitting record closes. 
Three investors shared the trends they’re seeing in the market and the areas they think could climb higher.
Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital Network, says fear of the Federal Reserve has faded, paving the way for fresh highs.
“I think the expectations for the Fed to do anything at Jackson Hole have been lowered quite a bit, and that was a big worry. If the Fed was talking about tapering ... amid the surge in delta [Covid] cases, that was not going to be great for the market. But now the base case for everyone is there’s going to be a lot of talk amongst central bankers at Jackson Hole, but it’s going to be no taper and there’s not going to be much action. So I think that’s a positive for the market and that’s why you’ve seen the reopening trade come back in vogue in the last few days.”
Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, sees investors buying even small pullbacks.
“It’s August and we’re looking for something to focus on, and Jackson Hole fills that void, but it’s usually more bark than bite. What you want to focus on here is there’s a lot of liquidity in the market; it’s not going anywhere in the near future here. We’re seeing this extreme tendency to buy the dips on the ... smallest of dips and when you have a more dovish Fed out there, I think you’re going to see more of a benefit towards the cyclicals and the reopening stocks.”
Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist at Hightower, looks back on the year so far and what is currently in favor.
“Remember how we talked about how 2021 has been a year of rotation. January through May, it was value versus growth. May to end of July, it was growth over value. And now, in the last couple of days we’ve seen a return to the cyclicals and to the reopen names, a little bit more value versus growth and a risk-on feel, which is why I think the meme stocks have done well, and I think it all has to do with delta.”

Chipmaker Micron’s stock could prove to be a strong catch-up trade, Joule Financial founder and chief investment officer Quint Tatro told CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
“It is trading at valuations now that are just ridiculously cheap,” a nearly seven times forward price-to-earnings multiple as of Tuesday’s close, Tatro said Tuesday.
“Let’s say they don’t hit those earnings because we do have a slowdown in memory chips, so, it’s 10 times or 12 times forward earnings — again, still ridiculously cheap,” he said.
With a “stellar balance sheet” and a sizable position in the computer chip market, Micron is poised to pop if demand for computers picks up, Tatro said.
Biogen’s stock may also be setting up for a breakout, MKM Partners chief market technician JC O’Hara said in the same interview.

"Space company Momentus begins trading on the Nasdaq, with new CEO after turbulent SPAC merger",EDT-20215:00-PM,"While Momentus has overhauled its financial forecasts, the company still has an ambitious target of more than $2 billion in revenue by 2027. The company booked no revenue last year, expects the same this year and just $5 million in 2022.
The company expects to be profitable on an EBITDA basis by 2024, a goal that will require Momentus fly 26 missions that year. Rood said Momentus – while it works to resolve the Pentagon’s concerns and acquire a launch license – has built two Vigoride spacecraft and will work on more as it finishes testing.
“We’re in the process of assembling and testing and qualifying additional Vigoride vehicles,” Rood said.
Momentus’ early missions will function as both tests of Vigoride and carrying paying customers’ satellites, he noted. The company is discounting its pricing for those customers.
“We are trying to make it more attractive for customers early on,” Rood said.
An additional key to Momentus’ success is the availability and cost of launches, with the former having steadily increased and the latter decreased in recent years – largely due to the ride-share launches Elon Musk’s SpaceX is offering on its Falcon 9 rockets.
“We have an agreement with SpaceX and we’re at the stage … where we can get the green light from the federal government for our launch licenses, then we’ll be able to book a manifest on a SpaceX rocket and go with them,” Rood said.
Its partnership with SpaceX is “very valuable and something that we prize,” Rood added. But Momentus cannot be dependent on just one means of getting to space, so Vigoride is designed to be “launch vehicle agnostic,” Rood said, and “there are other providers that we are talking to.”

“We don’t have any business dealings with Mikhail Kokorich or the other founders of the company. In fact, our national security agreement with the Defense Department prohibits that,” Rood said.
Asked whether Momentus or any of its team are communicating with Kokorich since he left, Rood said the conversations are not in a professional or technological capacity.
“If they are [talking to Kokorich], it’s of a social nature and we’re required to log it,” Rood said.Space company Momentus
debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday, completing a nearly yearlong and turbulent merger process that resulted in a new CEO and the departure of its founders.
“In terms of value for investors, I think we’re well positioned to meet some big market trends,” Momentus CEO John Rood, who began leading the company on Aug. 1, told CNBC. “There is a need for what we provide.”
Momentus stock slipped 2.6% in trading to close at $10.68.
The company this week completed its merger with Stable Road Capital, a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. A SPAC raises money from investors through an initial public offering and then uses the cash to acquire a private company and take it public.
Momentus’ road to the public market has been embattled on multiple fronts, with missions now delayed to mid-2022 at the earliest. National security concerns about its Russian co-founders, former CEO Mikhail Kokorich and Lev Khasis, led to both selling their stakes – in exchange for “roughly $40 million,” Rood said – and leaving the company.
Momentus’ valuation was then cut in half, from $1.1 billion to $567 million. And then, last month, the firm and Stable Road settled charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission that the companies misled investors and falsified the results from a 2019 prototype spacecraft test, paying about $8 million in civil penalties.
The company was expecting to have $310 million on its books to grow after the SPAC merger, but the complications of the process reduced that cash to about $150 million “to fund our operations,” Rood said.
“We think that gives us ample runway to go do our additional development work, to staff up, and some of the other things that we need to do,” he said.
Rood described Momentus as an “early stage technology company,” as it is now testing a new variation of its water-based plasma engines, called the microwave electrothermal thruster. The company told CNBC that its longest single firing of one of these engines during ground testing was 9.7 hours in a vacuum chamber, “significantly longer than what we anticipate requiring for any single firing on-orbit.”
The thruster is critical to Momentus’ business plan, which involves delivering satellites from rockets to specific orbits using a spacecraft called Vigoride. The spacecraft consists of a frame, an engine, solar panels, avionics and a set of satellite deployers, and is especially designed for satellites that hitch a ride on large rockets, an increasingly popular industry practice called ride-sharing.
The company had planned to launch its first Vigoride mission earlier this year, but the ongoing national security review led to the spacecraft’s removal from SpaceX ride-share launches. The delay has also led to Momentus losing customers, with its backlog of contracts dropping to $66 million from $90 million.Space company Momentus started trading on the Nasdaq on Friday, following a stormy merger process that led to the departure of its founders.
“In terms of value for investors, I think we’re well positioned to meet some big market trends,” Momentus CEO John Rood, who began leading the company on Aug. 1, told CNBC.
Delays due to national security concerns led to Momentus losing customers earlier this year, with its backlog of contracts dropping to $66 million from $90 million."

TaskUs founders’ path to Nasdaq started with high school parties and a yogurt venture in Argentina,EDT-20212:25-PM,"In addition to Maddock and Weir, the TaskUs IPO is a big windfall for Blackstone Group
, which invested about $250 million in 2018 and eventually controlled about two-thirds of the company. Including shares sold in the IPO, that stake is now worth about $1.7 billion.
Maddock and Weir were each able to maintain substantial ownership — 16% at the time of the IPO — because they’d only taken $15 million in outside funding prior to the Blackstone deal.
“We bootstrapped the business for seven years, living on a shoestring budget with our parents,” Weir said, in an interview. “Fortunately our parents didn’t charge us rent.”
Unlike the typical venture-backed tech company, TaskUs didn’t issue traditional stock options to its employees, because it was originally structured as a limited liability company. Rather, it created a “phantom stock plan” in 2015 and doled out grants that would appreciate in value as the company reached milestones and liquidity events.
Maddock said that following the Blackstone transaction in 2018, the company paid out $44 million to over 200 employees who owned phantom stock. After the IPO, he said a total of over $120 million will be paid to more than 400 employees.
“We have teammates and leaders in the Philippines who will make hundreds of thousands and, in some cases, over $1 million,” Maddock said.
WATCH: Cryptocurrencies see sudden sell-off — Here’s what experts sayMaddock and Weir both live in Austin, about 50 miles north of New Braunfels. Prior to the pandemic, they said, they spent about 75% of their time traveling to their various offices, including six to eight trips a year to the Philippines.
They’re anxious to get back on the road and into the air, though as the key persons for a publicly traded company, they have insurance policies that “forbid us from traveling on the same plane,” Maddock said.They moved back in with their parents and invested the $20,000 they’d saved up from the events business into their next venture: a task-based virtual assistant. They chose to start in the Philippines, one of the top countries in the world for call centers and outsourcing.
“We used our combined life savings to rent a one-room office on the side of a highway an hour south of Manila and hire our first few employees,” they wrote in the founders’ letter portion of the prospectus.
In their initial conversations with start-ups, Maddock and Weir said they quickly learned that busy executives didn’t want task-based help, but rather needed more thorough support services to assist them as they grew. TaskUs broadened its focus to cover more business processes, and the founders got some venture-backed start-ups on board.
“As we earned their trust, we took on more critical parts of their operations such as advanced technical support and critical content review,” they wrote.
By 2012, TaskUs was established enough to hit the radar of Uber, which was still early in its development although expanding rapidly and raising large venture rounds. Maddock said the message from Uber at the initial meeting in San Francisco was that the ride-hailing company would never outsource its services. That changed completely the following year.
“They called us back and said that outsourcing sounds like a good idea now,” Maddock said.
TaskUs started working with Uber in 2013, reviewing and onboarding drivers, according to the prospectus. In 2014, it began helping on rider and driver support. A year later, TaskUs had more than 2,000 people dedicated to Uber.
Similarly, TaskUs began working with Coinbase
as demand started surging. That was in 2017, when “bitcoin became a mainstream obsession, and support volumes spiked through the roof,” the filing says. Over time, TaskUs started handling fraud, compliance and customer safety needs for Coinbase.
The Philippines is still the company’s biggest hub, with more than 19,000, or 70%, of its employees located there. The U.S. is its second-biggest country, with over 4,000 employees, followed by India and Mexico.
TaskUs was originally headquartered in Santa Monica but started moving to Texas in 2016 with the opening of a San Antonio office, then to nearby New Braunfels, which became its current headquarters. New Braunfels is home to the Schlitterbahn, a 42-year-old water park that covers over 70 acres and is one of the 80,000-person town’s largest employers.Maddock and Weir became best friends two decades ago while attending Santa Monica High School, a few blocks from one of California’s most famous beaches. Weir stayed nearby for college at the University of Southern California, while Maddock went across country to New York University.
Still, they put their heads and pocketbooks together and formed their first business, an entertainment agency that rented out venues around Los Angeles and hosted alcohol-free parties for high school kids.
“We grew up in Los Angeles, and one thing we realized was that in the summer, kids in high school don’t have much to do,” Maddock said, in an interview. They called the business Club Access and ran it from 2005 to 2007, attracting 800 to 1,000 kids on the average Monday night.
After college, they decided to give Buenos Aires a shot. Weir had studied abroad in Argentina and wanted to start a business there. He and Maddock settled on starting a frozen yogurt shop. They flew down together and met investors as well as chemists who could mix the flavors. However, they quickly learned that opening up a small business in Argentina and earning pesos was no way to build wealth, and they abandoned the idea before it got off the ground.For Bryce Maddock and Jaspar Weir, the journey to the Nasdaq started in high school in southern California, continued through an entertainment venture for high-school kids and a failed yogurt business in Argentina, and finally ended up in a Texas town best known for its historic waterpark.
Now in their mid-30s, Maddock and Weir are each worth about $400 million and oversee a business with 27,500 employees worldwide. Thirteen years after they plowed their life savings into a venture called TaskUs, the company held its stock market debut on Friday and is valued at about $2.8 billion. The stock, trading under ticker symbol “TASK,” jumped 26% to $29.
TaskUs provides customer support services to fast-growing tech companies including Uber
, Netflix
, Coinbase
and Zoom
. Employees are spread across eight countries, and TaskUs dedicates hundreds or even thousands of staffers to its top clients so it can handle all their support-related issues. Revenue climbed 33% last year to $478 million, and TaskUs is profitable — a rarity among newly public tech companies — showing annual net income of $34.5 million last year.
Maddock, the CEO, said TaskUs is most commonly serving companies that “realize their growth is going to be so aggressive that they can no longer do it all themselves.”
For instance, Zoom called in early 2020, when the video chat company’s pandemic-fueled growth spurred a thirtyfold jump in support requests, according to the online roadshow ahead of the IPO. TaskUs soon had 700 employees working on the account.
Clients such as Zoom are the reason Maddock and Weir, the company’s president, were headed to the Nasdaq on Friday to ring the closing bell. But the trajectory wasn’t always up and to the right.Founded 13 years ago by a pair of childhood best friends, TaskUs held its Nasdaq debut on Friday.
Bryce Maddock and Jaspar Weir, the co-founders, are each worth about $400 million after the IPO.
They’ve built the business to 27,500 employees and close to $500 million in annual revenue by providing outsourced customer support services to companies such as Uber and Coinbase."
Robinhood debuts on Nasdaq – Jim Cramer and others share their take,EDT-20215:42-PM,"Robinhood
debuted Thursday on the Nasdaq, listing at $38 a share.
Here’s what experts think of the company and the stock.
Steve Weiss, chief investment officer and managing partner at Short Hills Capital, debunks some of the myths he sees around the company.
“No. 1, they’re not disruptors. They’re going into a business and they’re offering prices which are free, which many, many others are doing. So, I don’t think they’re a disruptor. No. 2, they haven’t democratized investing. That’s been democratized a long, long time ago and they’re talking out of two sides of their mouth because they are going to own I believe about 16% of the company, but control over 60% of the vote. So, let’s go where their intentions are, which is not one shareholder, one vote. That’s really poor governance. Now, I don’t think [CEO] Vlad [Tenev] – he’s done a great job taking it to this point, but thank god for the pandemic for them because that fueled the growth. They were bumping along, they were growing, but you cannot value this company as a disruptor when it’s not. You’ve got to value it comparing it to the others that offer a much broader line of services.”
Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital Network, said the timing of Robinhood’s IPO looks favorable.
“This is a red-hot environment for IPOs. … The valuation of this particular IPO is not that out of whack with the reality that we see for some of the fintech names. I know that you can compare it to Schwab and some of the other ones, but the reality is the growth trajectory of a name like this is far, far greater than what we’ve seen for some of the other names. So, I’ll give you an example. The average IPO last year at the time of pricing was 2½ times the price that it had in the last prior round, 2½ times. And this IPO was priced at about 2.7 times. So, it’s a little bit on the expensive side, but it’s actually not that expensive. And if you look at it in terms of the multiple of revenues on this particular company, it’s about 25 times, which, once again, it’s a little bit high, but given how much interest there is in fintech names, it doesn’t surprise me.”
Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s “Mad Money,” said the company has to contend with its fair share of problems.
“I think we all know that they had problems. They have to grow into that. Look, I’m not going to defend a lot of the things. I mean, there’s a controversies page in the Atlantic Equities piece that is … devastating if you read it. You would never own the stock. But … I guess what I’m saying is that we may not think that the app disrupted things, but there are a lot of people in this industry who wish they had those 22 million [users].”
Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown would not buy it here, though is watching it closely.
“I’m personally not interested in owning it, but I’m fascinated by the story and everything that they’ve built. I think a lot of this really started out as regulatory arbitrage. The neat trick was getting big enough fast enough before anybody knew what was happening. And they just paid a big fine related to some of that regulatory arbitrage, so, maybe they’ll clean up their act. But in the end, this is not an investing business. This is online gambling. If I wanted to invest in that, I’d probably be more interested in DraftKings. I don’t really see this as being vastly superior in any way to any of the other publicly traded brokerages. In fact, it’s inferior in many ways. The median Robinhood customer has a $240 balance in their account. The average is about $5,000. You compare that metric with a Charles Schwab and you would just say, ‘I want to own Schwab.’ This is going to have an outrageous valuation because of how fast it’s growing, and that’s undeniable. You can’t take that away from them. But what are they really growing? And if you take out payment for order flow, if you say, ‘Alright, 75% of this company’s revenue is payment for order flow,’ which is basically allowing one group of investors to take advantage of another group of investors, if that’s the whole business, I’m not sure that that’s the kind of thing that I want to personally invest in. I also would note that … a lot of the growth in revenue over the last year has come from things like dogecoin. So, you could make the case that there’s going to be more of that in the future and that the margins for crypto trading will stay high. I doubt it.”

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe major averages took steep losses to start the week as investors continued their rotation out of technology stocks amid rising bond yields.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 323.54 points to 34,002.92, despite large gains in Merck. The S&P 500 shed 1.3% to 4,300.46. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 2.1% to 14,255.48.
Large tech shares like Apple,
Nvidia
, Amazon
and Microsoft
were lower as investors eyed bond yields. A surge in rates to end September knocked highly valued tech stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield
was slightly higher Monday, trading around 1.48%. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit 1.56% last week, its highest point since June, with investors concerned about inflationary pressures and tighter monetary policy.
Social media giant Facebook
lost 4.9% after being accused of a “betrayal of democracy” by a whistleblower who revealed her identity on Sunday.
“The financial markets are adjusting leadership to reflect another Covid-induced reopening cycle,” said Jim Paulsen, Leuthold Group chief investment strategist. “That is, commodities are rising, bond yields are rising, cyclical sectors and small cap stocks are outpacing, and technology and growth stocks in general are underperforming.”
On the positive side, Tesla
rose 0.8% after the company said this weekend that it delivered 241,300 electric vehicles during the third quarter, well above analysts estimates.
Merck
shares gained 2.1%, following through on an 8% surge on Friday after the drug maker said its oral antiviral treatment developed with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics for Covid-19 reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 50% for patients with mild or moderate cases.
Southwest rose 1.3% after an upgrade to overweight from equal weight from Barclays. The same analyst upgraded the North American Airlines sector to positive from neutral.
Energy stocks also rose amid an uptick in oil prices. Exxon Mobil
gained 1.3% and ConocoPhillips
rallied 2%.
“At these extremely lofty valuations stock prices are very sensitive to modest changes in incremental capital flows and it appears that there is some ‘performance chasing’ going on as the energy space is attracting capital which is trying to make it look like they had exposure to oil & gas (window dressing) and that means less money flowing into tech,” said Mark Yusko, Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO and chief investment officer.
Friday marked the first trading day of October and the final quarter of 2021. The major averages rose that day on promising data for Merck’s oral treatment for Covid-19, which boosted stocks tied to the economic reopening.
The market rebound followed a rough September plagued by fears of inflation, Federal Reserve tapering and rising interest rates. The S&P 500 finished the month down 4.8%, breaking a seven-month winning streak. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite fell 4.3% and 5.3%, respectively, suffering their worst months of the year.
“The on-again, off-again nervousness about Federal monetary policy, the disruption among supply chains and the potential for higher taxes (along with other concerns such as inflation risk and higher taxes) have kept market enthusiasm in check,” wrote John Stoltzfus, Oppenheimer Asset Management’s chief investment strategist, in a note Monday. “Meanwhile rotation and rebalancing efforts along with some profit taking by skeptics, bears and nervous investors account for a significant part of market activity on any given day.”
“Curiously, investor worries about COVID-19 and its variant seem to have begun to play a lesser day-to-day ‘worry role’ in the markets of late than over the course of the summer,” he added.
The fourth quarter is typically a good period for stocks, but overhangs like central bank tightening, the debt ceiling, Chinese developer Evergrande and Covid-19 could keep investors cautious. Heading into the fourth quarter, more than half of all S&P stocks are off at least 10%.

Ablin said he was just asked about NFTs by a client on Thursday. While he admits to not having a strong viewpoint on them, he said that if recipients of stimulus money opt for risky investments instead of traveling and buying consumer goods, the market could look very different in the coming months.
“If it really doesn’t get spent but gets plowed into the market, that would pull the rug out from under our thesis,” Ablin said. For example, he said, “If instead of taking their vacation, they go buy Tesla stock.”
Tesla shares did jump 16% this week. But that was after tumbling 30% over the prior month.

Even though Biden and the Democratic Congress are focused on expanding green energy alternatives, the current outlook for travel and getting back to work is benefiting traditional oil and gas companies.

A DAY AGO
Market experts have been predicting a tech cooldown for years and have been consistently wrong, thanks to the increasing dominance of mega-cap companies like Apple
and Amazon
, the frenzy around Tesla
and the massive shift in spending to cloud computing.
“It’s been years of frustration trying to get that trade right,” said Jack Ablin, who oversees $12.5 billion as chief investment officer at Cresset.
Ablin said this time feels different. Starting in the fourth quarter, his firm rolled out a new “quality dividend strategy,” moving clients out of technology and into industrials, financials, materials and energy companies. He was betting on a Democratic sweep in November, followed by a big stimulus package that would pump money into the economy, leading to inflation and higher interest rates.While the Nasdaq broke its string of three straight weekly losses, it trailed the Dow yet again.
The Dow has outperformed the Nasdaq for four consecutive weeks for the first time since April 2016.

Embattled EV start-up Faraday Future gets second act with Nasdaq SPAC debut,EDT-20214:17-PM,"Jia remains with the company as chief product and user officer but does not hold an ownership stake, according to Breitfeld.
Despite the changes and new funding, Guidehouse Insights principal analyst Sam Abuelsamid believes Faraday Future still has significant hurdles to be successful. One obstacle is a more competitive market than the company’s original plans from CES 2017.
“They are launching with just one car, with others in following years and we’ll see if they can actually get it into production,” he said. “If it does arrive, then they’re entering a much more crowded and tougher market to compete in for somebody like Faraday Future that has no track record or, to the extent they have a track record, it’s a very spotty one.”
Breitfeld argues that now is a “better time” to launch anew because there’s more government support for EVs as well as more demand from consumers. But he knows challenges remain to get to market and separate itself from its past and other speculative SPAC-backed companies.
“I don’t like this grouping approach too much because SPAC is basically a tool of going to market,” he said. “Of course, time will show who really will survive and how this will work out, but we feel we’re in a very comfortable and strong position.”Aside from a cash influx, Faraday Future’s SPAC deal helps erase up to $150 million in debt owed to suppliers, which will be taking a stake in the post-merged company, Breitfield said. The company declined to disclose what percentage of Faraday Future the suppliers will hold and how much debt will be erased.
The debt-to-equity swap is one of several things Breitfeld said the company needed to complete before it could go public and launch the vehicle. Others included changing the perception of the company with media and investors as well as better executing its plans and putting controversies with China and its founder, Jia, behind it.
“This is all behind us,” Breitfeld said in a previous interview in February. “This is the past and this is a different company now.”Faraday Future is expected to build 2,400 vehicles next year, followed by 38,600 units in 2023 and more than 300,000 vehicles in 2025. That compares to Lucid at 20,000 next year and 135,000 vehicles by 2025.
Faraday has a nearly completed plant in California that’s capable of producing up to 30,000 vehicles a year. It also has plans for manufacturing partnerships in South Korea and China.  
Breitfeld said the company has more than 14,000 reservations for the FF 91, but many of them don’t include down payments. That’s down from a reported 64,000 reservations following the car’s debut in 2017, which were free or through a $5,000 deposit for a “priority reservation.”Breitfeld, a former BMW executive, said the plan he sold to investors is achievable. It includes beginning production of limited-edition FF 91 for $180,000 in the next 12 months, followed by less expensive models and other EVs in the months and years to come.
“There’s one simple, single plan for the next 12 months and this is getting the car out to the customers,” he said. “It’s what I promised and what I’m going to deliver.”
Breitfeld said he plans to “under promise and over deliver” to investors. The company’s production ramp-up is faster than fellow luxury EV start-up Lucid, which is expected to begin deliveries of its first vehicle — a $169,000 sedan called the Air “Dream Edition” — later this year.Faraday Future was expected to be the “next Tesla
.” It was going to be a leader in electric vehicles with its groundbreaking FF 91 crossover that would usher in an “entirely new species” of automobile.
Those were some of the claims surrounding the California EV start-up during an elaborate unveiling of the FF 91 at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2017. If all had gone to plan, the vehicle would have been on the market now for several years, ahead of an influx of EVs from emerging start-ups and traditional automakers.
Instead, the opposite happened. The executives that made those proclamations left Faraday Future; it abandoned a plan for a $1 billion factory in Nevada; and it has yet to build one vehicle. Its founder and CEO, Chinese billionaire Jia “YT” Yueting, also filed for bankruptcy in 2019.
But Faraday Future now has new life – and capital – thanks to a SPAC deal with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp. that is providing the embattled automaker with $1 billion.
It’s a new beginning for Faraday Future but also a countdown to proving its worth to investors, including starting production and sales of the FF 91 within a year from now.
“We have been able to convince the capital market that this is a different company now, a company which can deliver a serious business plan,” Faraday Future CEO Carsten Breitfeld said in an interview. “But now we have to deliver, and this is absolutely key.”
The company’s shares shot up by more than 15% minutes into its debut Thursday on the Nasdaq under the ticker FFIE.
But the gains weren’t sustainable, with the stock closing at $13.98 a share, up 1.5%.
Delivering on plans is something newly public EV start-ups have not been able to do. Starting with Nikola
last year, SPAC deals for the automotive industry exploded, but reality has set in for many companies. Bold claims by executives have led to federal investigations into EV start-ups such as Nikola, Canoo
and Lordstown Motors
, which last month warned investors of potential bankruptcy concerns.
Other EV start-ups such as privately held Rivian and Lucid, which is soon expected to go public via a SPAC merger, have delayed production and delivery of their first vehicles.
“Building a vehicle is not that easy to do,” IHS Markit principal automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley said. “It’s a very complex process and it’s very capital intensive. Even experienced automakers run into situations from time to time where programs are delayed.”Following years of turmoil, Faraday Future has new life – and $1 billion in fresh capital – as it begins trading on the Nasdaq following a SPAC deal.
The company was once considered the “next Tesla” that would be a leader in the EV industry, but things didn’t go to plan.
Faraday Future plans to begin production of a limited-edition $180,000 EV in the next 12 months, followed by less expensive models and other EVs in the years ahead."

"The Nasdaq must recoup this one level to prevent an even bigger downturn, strategist says",EST-20214:52-PM,"He explains that it aligns with a trend line stretching back to March lows of last year as well as the neckline of a head and shoulders pattern. When the index crosses below the neckline, it suggests a change in trend.
“If we don’t get a real sharp bounceback over the next two days and we keep meaningfully below those levels, I think that’s going to tell us that we still need more downside here before we find a bottom to this sell-off, which is almost 10% already,” Maley said.
Even after this week’s sell-offs, valuations on the index appear too high to be attractive to Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global and chief market strategist at Lido Advisors. She says the price-earnings ratio should be far lower.
“You’re looking at a fair value of 20 times if you look at long-term averages. Now that probably won’t get down that low because even forward estimates for earnings still are expecting … 28% earnings growth next year. So I don’t think we necessarily have to fall all the way back to 20, but the difference between 30 and 20 is a pretty big difference in terms of a percentage fall,” Sanchez said during the same segment.

“It’s going to be interesting to see what happens in the next 24 hours because we have the employment number coming out [Friday] morning. If that can cause the yields to come back down, maybe these tech stocks can rally back, and that will be helpful but we need to recover that 13,000 level very, very quickly because that is a key, key support level,” Maley said."

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buy“The Washington goings-on certainly don’t help, as we have a lot of uncertainty around tax policy and of course the debt ceiling,” said Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist at LPL Financial.
While tech stocks dragged down the broader market, sectors tied to the economic reopening outperformed and energy names saw a slight gain. Shares of Ford rose 1% after the company announced plans to build new production facilities in the U.S.
“I’m having actually a little deja vu to last fall, if you remember last September, when we saw interest rates move a little bit and the reaction in tech,” said Jeff Kilburg, the chief investment officer at Sanctuary Wealth. “And the selling pressure in tech really was a catalyst last fall for the reflation and rotation trade, and again here we are.”Tech shares fell as a rapid rise in rates makes their future cash flows less valuable, and in turn makes the popular stocks appear overvalued. Higher rates also hinder tech companies’ ability to fund their growth and buy back stock.
Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet lost more than 3%, while Amazon dropped more than 2%. Large chip stocks struggled, with Nvidia sliding 4.5%.
Also weighing on sentiment was a budget showdown in Washington. Senate Republicans blocked a House-passed bill Monday that would have funded the government into December and suspended the debt ceiling until December of 2022.
Congress must approve government funding by Friday to avoid a shutdown, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Congress in a letter on Tuesday that lawmakers need to raise the debt limit by Oct. 18 to avoid a government default. President Biden’s massive infrastructure plan also faces an uncertain future.Loading chart...U.S. stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, with tech names dragging down the broader markets as Treasury yields traded near three-month highs and lawmakers in Washington continued their budget stalemate.
The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.83% to 14,546.68 for its worst day since March and the S&P 500 shed 2.04% to finish at 4,352.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 569.38 points, or 1.63%, to close at 34,299.99.
The 10-year Treasury yield
 continued its speedy climb on Tuesday, rising as high as 1.567% as investors bet the Fed would carry through on its promise to curb its emergency bond-buying stimulus as inflation jumps. The 10-year yield, which traded as low as 1.13% as recently as August, has reversed dramatically to the highest levels since June after the Fed signaled last week it would taper its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases “soon.”
“The market’s been steadily coming around to the reality that yields were awfully low relative to the fundamentals. Now the Fed is shifting, and everybody’s shifting their positions, all at once, as we tend to do,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research."
"Traders who bet against stocks made a killing in 2022, as short sellers netted $300 billion",AGO-4-HOURS,"When an investor sells a stock “short” they borrow shares from a broker and sell them in hopes of buying the stock back later at a lower price. It’s a tactic that does best when the broader market is hurting. Short seller returns came in below the major indexes when the market gained value in 2019 through 2021, but beat the averages when they ended the year down in 2018.
It’s worth noting that the total amount shorted last year was below 2021, when the $1 trillion threshold was broken, but higher than in 2018 through 2020.
Short sellers still needed to be good stock pickers in 2022 as different sectors and individual holdings could produce vastly different results, Dusaniwsky said.
For instance, the best sector to short last year was beat down communication services stocks, which produced a return on shorted holdings of 56.7%. Energy was the worst, and posted a 28% loss on shorted holdings, S3 Partners said.
Short- and long-term performance are typically inversed. That’s because investors usually move short on holdings that they expect to lose value, so energy — which was the only winning S&P 500 sector in 2022 — would not be a target for shorting as investors watched share values rise despite the broader market’s decline.
And choosing sector orientation is “only half the battle” given the variety of stocks within each one. Within consumer staples, for example, Beyond Meat
had the biggest return on short selling at 128.2%. French fry producer Lamb Weston
was the least profitable in its sector, and lost 43.9%.
Carvana
, which was beat down as used car demand slid, had the best short performance of all stocks with at least $100 million in short interest, recording a 377.6% gain.
On the flip side, Madrigal Pharma
was the worst to short. Bets against the company lost 345.4%. The stock rallied in December on the back of well-received drug trial data.Traders who shorted stocks won big in 2022, according to S3 Partners.
Shorted stocks had a return of 30.8% in 2022, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, the firm’s managing director of predictive analytics. That means short sellers outperformed the broader market, which suffered its biggest losses since 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
, S&P 500
and Nasdaq Composite
lost 8.8%, 19.4% and 33.1%, respectively, last year.

Tech’s had a brutal year. But four stocks have a bright future, investor says
Zavier Ong
A DAY AGO
“What we need to do is de-risk 2023 numbers,” the firm’s vice chair of technology investment banking told CNBC’s “Fast Money” on Thursday. “When we go through fourth quarter earnings, I think companies will indicate a reduction in force. They’ll talk about cutting back on go-to-market spending... This is all encouraging.”
Sherlund’s expertise is software. He hit No. 1 on Institutional Investor’s all-star analyst list 17 times in a row when he was an analyst.
And, he’s known for leading Goldman Sachs’ technology research team through the 2000 dot-com bubble, a time he calls “breathtaking.” The latest market backdrop reminds him of prior downturns.
“2022 was a terrible year for these [software] stocks,” said Sherlund. “We’ve seen tremendous compression in valuation. The good news is that downturns are ultimately followed by upturns. So, we’ve just got a lot of crosscurrents near-term.”
His latest market forecast coincides with the tech-heavy Nasdaq
’s latest struggles. It fell 1.47% to 10,305.24 on Thursday, and it’s on the cusp of a five-week losing streak.
Sherlund’s base case is the move to high-growth areas such as the cloud will provide a long-term boost to software stocks.
“People have to recognize that this is an economically sensitive sector,” he said. “Some of the demand may have been pulled forward during the pandemic period and when rates were zero.”
Sherlund contends powerful secular tailwinds will ultimately lift the group. And, it should help kick off consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions in the year’s second half.
“There will be an inclination to pick up the phone and have that M&A conversation where in the past it was probably little incentive to do that,” said Sherlund. “There’s an awful lot of dry powder out there.”
He believes stability later this year in the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike trajectory will spark deal-making by helping the challenged leveraged finance market.
“That could finance a lot more M&A and LBOs [leveraged buyouts],” Sherlund said.

"Astra stock rises on Nasdaq debut, as space company aims to launch rockets daily",EDT-20214:05-PM,"While several other space companies are going public via SPACs, and despite Astra’s competitors like Rocket Lab or Virgin Orbit in the private rocket launch market, Kemp sees the industry’s momentum and growth as a positive sign for his company’s future.
“I think competition is great,” Kemp said. “Our sphere is trying to get a whole new economy in low Earth orbit, and it’s meant to improve life on Earth.”
Additionally, Brannon emphasized that Astra’s focus on simplicity and manufacturability gives it an edge v. its competitors.
“The way that we got to space three years faster than anyone else was the fact that we iterate,” Brannon said. “You put more up into space, you learn more.”

Sign up to start a free trial today.The company’s last launch in December reached space, but the Rocket 3.2 vehicle came just short of orbit. However, the mission gave Astra leadership the confidence that its next launch, Rocket 3.3, can carry paying customers. Kemp said Rocket 3.3 is in testing currently, with the company remaining on track to launch the mission “this summer.”
Astra plans to manufacture a dozen of the Rocket 3 series vehicles, with the next few currently in production.
“We’ll start to roll these things off the production line monthly,” Kemp said. “Our goal is to hit a monthly cadence by the end of the year, and then really just ramp from there. We’ve planned 15 launches for 2022.”
Astra currently launches from Kodiak, Alaska, but the company has identified more spaceports around the world for launches. With a system that requires just a few people to set up for a launch, Kemp emphasized that Astra does not want “to be locked in a single location.”Astra has staffed up heavily since deciding to go public, adding new leadership from Apple
, Tesla
, Blue Origin and more.
“We’ve almost invested more time in building the team for the last six months than we have in this transaction, because we knew this day was coming,” Kemp said.
Astra CFO Kelyn Brannon, who joined the company in December, has a background from a variety of Silicon Valley companies, including as Amazon’s
chief accounting officer in the late 1990s.
“Astra right now reminds me of my time at Amazon,” Brannon told CNBC. “I remember standing there and talking with [founder Jeff] Bezos, and him buying every server known to mankind and building these big huge data centers.”
“We want to be the AWS of space,” Brannon added.Shares of rocket builder Astra Space
began trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq, as it became the latest space company to go public after closing a SPAC deal.
Astra trades under the ticker ASTR, with shares previously listed under the special purpose acquisition company Holicity.
“Now we have a space company that everyone can invest in on the public markets,” Astra CEO Chris Kemp told CNBC. “The same kinds of things you do to make a rocket great are the same behaviors that you have to invest in to make a company great. You don’t want any inefficiencies.”
The stock jumped as much as 21% in midday trading, before giving up most of the gains to finish the day up 4.5% at $12.90 a share.
Closing its merger with Holicity nets Astra about $500 million in new capital, which the company plans to use to build out production of its small rockets, expand its facilities in Alameda, California, and grow its spacecraft and spaceport business lines. Astra’s goal is to launch as many as its 40-foot-tall rockets as it can, aiming to launch one rocket a day by 2025 and drop its $2.5 million price point even further.Shares of rocket builder Astra Space began trading Wednesday on the Nasdaq.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is testifying before the House of Representatives Tuesday on the central bank’s response to the pandemic. His remarks, which were released ahead of the hearing Monday evening, supported the notion that the Fed is ready to soon start discussing removing some of its unprecedented stimulus measures enacted during the pandemic.
Indexes hit their highs of the session as Powell answered questions from House members. There was no headline from Powell that looked to be clearly responsible for the gains, but the Fed chief was bullish on the economic comeback and maintained that inflation forces were temporary. There also could have been some relief buying from traders worried that Powell would be a bit more hawkish on rate increases than the central bank was last week.
“Since we last met, the economy has shown sustained improvement,” Powell said Tuesday, according to the Fed release. “Widespread vaccinations have joined unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions in providing strong support to the recovery. Indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen, and real GDP this year appears to be on track to post its fastest rate of increase in decades.”
“Inflation has increased notably in recent months,” Powell said. But the Fed chief noted that most of those are a temporary effect and that inflation should settle back to 2% over the long term."

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyThe S&P 500 has had a pretty smooth ride so far in 2021, up more than 20% without even a 5% pullback. The benchmark has closed above its 200-day moving average, a measure of the long-term trend, for 296 days in a row.
So some strategists are on the lookout for a correction in September given that stocks haven’t had a significant one since last October, combined with the highly anticipated meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank in September and the continued worry about the delta Covid variant.
“Although this bull market has laughed at nearly all the worry signs in 2021, let’s not forget that September is historically the worst month of the year for stocks,” said LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. “Even last year, in the face of a huge rally off the March 2020 lows, we saw a nearly 10% correction in the middle of September.”
He added that any weakness could be short-term and contained in the 5% to 8% range.
“This bull market is alive and well and we would view any potential weakness as an opportunity,” he said.The S&P 500 closed the first trading day of September near the flatline as the strength in technology shares faded, while investors digested a disappointing employment report.

The ADP report is a precursor to the official August U.S. non-farm payrolls data, which will be released Friday. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect 720,000 jobs were created in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%.

Relative to those companies and others in the IPO pipeline, Coinbase’s recent growth is unparalleled. The company said last week in announcing preliminary first-quarter results that revenue in the period surged ninefold from a year ago to $1.8 billion, and net income climbed from $32 million to between $730 million and $800 million. The number of monthly transacting users (MTUs) climbed from 2.8 million three months earlier to 6.1 million.
For full-year 2020, revenue more than doubled to $1.28 billion, and the company swung from a loss in 2019 to a profit of $322.3 million.
Most transactions on Coinbase involve the purchase of bitcoin or ethereum, which have been on a historic tear, climbing more than 800% and 1,300%, respectively, in the past year. The company has said that its short-term performance will largely be determined by crypto prices.
Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s co-founder and CEO, owns 39.6 million shares. In August, Armstrong was granted a multibillion-dollar performance award tied to the company’s stock price, potentially letting him purchase up to 9.29 million options at $23.46 over 10 years. 
WATCH: Coinbase public debut is historic moment for cryptocurrenciesCoinbase shares closed at $328.28 in their Nasdaq debut on Wednesday, giving the cryptocurrency exchange an initial market cap of $85.8 billion on a fully diluted basis.
The shares opened at $381 and quickly shot up as high as $429.54, before dropping back below the debut price and reaching a low of around $310. The price was still well above the reference price of $250 set Tuesday night, though no shares changed hands at that price.
Skirting the traditional IPO process, Coinbase listed its stock directly, allowing employees and existing shareholders to sell shares immediately at a market-based price. In pursuing a direct listing, Coinbase followed tech companies like Spotify, Slack, Palantir and Roblox, which helped standardize the process.
Excluding options and restricted stock units, Coinbase closed the day with a market cap of about $62 billion.
Founded in 2012 as a way to simplify the purchase of bitcoin, Coinbase has emerged as the most popular crypto exchange in the U.S. and soared in value alongside digital currencies bitcoin and ethereum. The service now has 56 million users, up from 43 million at the end of 2020 and 32 million the year before that.

“The 10-year Treasury bond yield has continued rising in recent days and exploded higher in [Wednesday’s] trading, sending a strong message that the delta variant of Covid may be peaking in the U.S. which should improve confidence, restart economic reopenings, and drive investment flows toward small caps and cyclicals,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to make remarks on Friday as part of the central bank’s summit. The Fed has been purchasing at least $120 billion of bonds per month to bolster the economy in reaction to the pandemic.
“Expect investors to keep an eye on the Fed’s symposium the rest of this week for any comments about tapering or timing for interest rate hikes,” Paulsen said. “Either unexpected commentary from the Fed or a failure or success in scaling 4,500 could bring additional volatility to the stock and bond markets.”

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyMixed economic data did little to change the sour mood. Weekly initial jobless claims came in at 353,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday, a slight increase from the prior week’s 349,000 and more than economists expected.
Economic growth totaled 6.6% in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department’s second reading released on Thursday. That was a slight revision upward from the 6.5% annual increase previously reported, but slightly lower than the Dow Jones estimate of 6.7%.
The highly anticipated Jackson Hole symposium from the Fed will be held virtually this year on Friday, with many central bank speakers making remarks to the media beginning Thursday. At the event, central bankers could provide updates on their plan around tapering the Fed’s monthly bond purchases.
Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, told CNBC Thursday morning that “given the progress we’ve seen,” Fed tapering is “appropriate,” though she didn’t specify when she thinks it should start.
“When you look at the job gains we saw last month, the month before, you look at the level of inflation right now, I think it would suggest that the level of accommodation we’re providing right now is probably not needed in this scenario,” she said. “So I would be ready to talk about taper sooner rather than later.”
James Bullard, St. Louis Fed president, said the central bank should begin those efforts soon and wrap them up by the end of March to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating.
“I think we want to get going on taper. Get the taper finished by the end of the first quarter next year,” Bullard told CNBC Thursday. “And then we can evaluate what the situation is and we’ll be able to see at that point whether inflation has moderated and if that’s the case we’ll be in great shape. If it hasn’t moderated, we’re going to have to be more aggressive to contain inflation.”

Breakout or breakdown? Why the Nasdaq’s two decade leadership cycle may withstand rising rates,EDT-20215:02-PM,"The Leuthold Group’s Jim Paulsen has a message for investors: Don’t give up on Big Tech.
According to the firm’s chief investment strategist, Nasdaq volatility associated with rising Treasury Note yields
may not be enough to permanently derail its two decade leadership cycle.
“It’s quite a coincidence that that same peak we had three weeks ago in both the Nasdaq
and S&P 500 technology index
... to the overall S&P occurred also right on the same level as the dot-com top a little over 20 years ago,” Paulsen told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday. “That relative high has been enforced ever since.”
In a recent note to clients, Paulsen tackled whether growth plays, which include Big Tech, were “peaking out” or “breaking out.” He found support for both scenarios. But Paulsen believes it’s more likely the group will endure through higher rates.
“It might have less to do with yields than it does with just facing a glass ceiling,” he added. “I’m not totally convinced that we’re breaking down. We might just be hitting the ceiling, bouncing down for a minute and maybe going to take it out yet at some point here in the future.”
Paulsen contends Big Tech and growth, which he classifies as “New-Era” stocks, will retain their attractiveness to investors.
“If it does ultimately achieve a new relative-price high, might its leadership persevere and perhaps even strengthen? That is what happened the last two times the Nasdaq spent multiple years as an underperformer,” he wrote.
Despite his optimism, Paulsen acknowledges it’s reasonable to expect a phase of underperformance, consolidation or even a temporary meltdown.
“It’s important to realize that we’re just one year into this new economic expansion — probably both the expansion and the bull market are going to be a multi-year event in which tech will continue to play a fairly dominant role,” he said. “During the periods of time where cyclicality takes a hit and it’s going to in periods, I think tech is going to hold up your portfolio.”
So, Paulsen, who oversees about $1 billion in assets under management, isn’t bailing on Big Tech.
“We’re underweighted tech, but not by a lot,” said Paulsen, who is overweight areas such as small caps
, value and international stocks. “It’s likely to underperform over the next year as the economy really booms here, but I’m not totally sold that it will.”
On “Trading Nation” last September, Paulsen, a long-time market bull, recommended taking advantage of Wall Street pessimism while you still can. Since that appearance, the Nasdaq is up 20%, and he’s maintaining his enthusiasm.
“It’s still going to be the leader of the future,” Paulsen said.
The Nasdaq dropped 0.6% to 13,319.87 on Friday as the benchmark 10-year Treasury Note yield hit 1.64%, its highest level in 13 months. But the tech heavy index, which is 6% off its all-time high, still ended the week up more than 3%.

DisclaimerThe rotation out of high-growth tech names rolls on.
The Nasdaq 100
, which has a heavy tech focus, has come under pressure again, and more than half of its components are now in a correction or worse. Some of the worst hit, such as Zoom Video
, Peloton
, Splunk
and Baidu
, have fallen more than 40% from their 52-week highs.
Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments, highlights one Nasdaq 100 component as the stock best positioned to rebound.
“It would be Microsoft
,” Tengler told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “This is not March of 2000 when the 10-year
was at 6.5%, and we were at the end of a business and earnings cycle. In fact, tech capex is now about 50% of total capex, so we want names [that] are going to participate and benefit from that.”
Tech has generally underperformed this year on fears of inflation and a rise in yields. The 10-year Treasury yield has climbed to 1.63%, still historically low, as Tengler notes.
“Microsoft has sort of been trading sideways, in line with the market this year, but grew revenues at 90% last quarter and raised guidance,” she said. “We like revenues because they’re a fact, so this is a company we want to own for the next three to five years or you want to buy for your grandkids.”
Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Capital, is also bullish on Microsoft and sees technical signs that suggest more gains ahead.
“Ahead of earnings, they had a tremendous run. We trimmed our positions in half in Microsoft ahead of earnings. I’m simply putting that back on here [Tuesday],” Baruch said during the same interview."

Nasdaq-listed Chinese electric carmaker Li Auto to raise up to $1.93 billion from Hong Kong listing,EDT-20214:21-AM,"Chinese electric vehicle makers are trying to take advantage of the excitement around the industry to raise money.
Last month, Li Auto rival Xpeng
raised around $1.8 billion in a Hong Kong listing.
But Li Auto is also tapping into a trend of U.S.-listed Chinese companies looking to raise money closer to home. Alibaba
, NetEase
and JD.com
are among China’s technology giants that have carried out secondary listings.
Doing a secondary listing in Hong Kong also helps to hedge against some of the geopolitical risk that has spilled over into financial market regulation.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules that impose stricter auditing requirements for foreign firms listed in the U.S. Those requirements carry the threat of delisting for companies that run afoul of the rules.
And last month, the SEC also said it will require additional disclosures from Chinese companies looking to list on U.S. exchanges.
Li Auto said that it plans to use the proceeds of its share offering for research and development into technologies and future models, as well as expanding production capacity and its retail store footprint.
Competition in the Chinese electric vehicle market is getting intense. Start-ups like Li Auto, Xpeng and Nio
are competing against established players like BYD
and Tesla
as well as traditional automakers.
Li Auto said Sunday it delivered 8,589 Li One vehicles in July, a monthly record. The Li One SUV is the company’s only model on the market. It’s a hybrid vehicle that comes with a fuel tank for charging the battery, extending the 180-kilometer driving range by about 620 km (385.35 miles).GUANGZHOU, China — Chinese electric vehicle start-up Li Auto

Results at Tesla were buoyed by regulatory credits and a $101 million positive impact from bitcoin sales. Revenue of $10.39 billion for the quarter also exceeded estimates. Tesla delivered 184,800 Model 3 and Model Y cars in Q1, beating expectations and setting a company record. (CNBC)
Among Tuesday’s earnings before the opening bell, UPS
(UPS) easily beat estimates with first-quarter profit of $2.77 per share and revenue of nearly $23 billion, benefiting from a surge in online purchases during the Covid pandemic. Shares soared more than 6% in premarket trading. (Reuters)

"Dow drops 600 points as tech stocks fall again, Nasdaq down 10% in 3 days",EDT-20204:57-PM,"Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday as another massive drop in tech put the Nasdaq Composite in correction territory and led to the S&P 500′s worst three-day stretch in months. 
The Nasdaq Composite
dropped 4.1% to end the day at 10,847.69. Tuesday’s drop put the tech-heavy Nasdaq down 10% over the past three days. It marks the Nasdaq’s worst three-day stretch since August. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
plunged 632.42 points, or 2.3%, to 27,500.89. The S&P 500 slid 2.8% to 3,331.84. The broader-market index was down nearly 7% over the past three days, its worst three-day stretch since June.
Tesla
plunged 21.1% — its biggest one-day drop on record — after the S&P Dow Jones Indices failed to add the surging and speculative stock to the S&P 500 after the bell Friday. Investors were betting on inclusion of the stock into the S&P 500, hoping for the stamp of approval on the rally by S&P. The snub shows the risks to the overheating Nasdaq trade.
Apple dropped 6.7% to lead tech lower. Over the past three sessions, the Dow component has plunged more than 14%. According to Bespoke Investment Group, that’s the stock’s worst three-day stretch since October 2008.
Facebook and Amazon were both down more than 4%. Microsoft fell 6.7%. Netflix closed 1.8% lower and Alphabet lost 3.6%. Zoom Video fell by 5.1%. The S&P 500 tech sector dropped 4.6% and closed Tuesday’s session more than 11% below an all-time high set on Sept. 2.
“High valuations in the mega-cap stocks are stretched far beyond historical levels,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “The technical indicators – high margin debt, fully invested mutual funds, CBOE options data showing record call volume, Wall Street letter writers at bullish levels -- pointed to excessive optimism in the market which often suggests a consolidation/correction phase is likely.”
Shares of Softbank dropped 7% on Monday in Japan as it was identified as the big options buyer making a bet in the billions on tech stocks continuing to surge. The tech trade could lose some of its firepower if Softbank were to curb those bets.
Semiconductor stocks were under pressure amid simmering U.S.-China trade tensions. Nvidia and Micron fell 5.6% and 3.2%, respectively. Applied Materials dropped 8.7%. Advanced Micro Devices pulled back by 4%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) closed 4.4% lower. 
China accused the U.S. of “bullying” as it launched a global data security initiative on Tuesday. That came as Washington continues to pressure China’s largest tech firms and lobby countries around the world to block them. President Donald Trump also recently entertained the idea of “decoupling” from China, or refusing to do business with the country.
Wall Street was coming off its first weekly decline in six weeks after a big reversal in major technology stocks. Steep losses in Amazon
, Apple,
Microsoft
and Facebook
 — 2020′s market leaders — drove the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to its worst week since March 20. The Dow and S&P 500 posted their biggest weekly losses since June. 
Many on Wall Street believe the weakness derived from worries that the massive tech run-up pushed valuations to unsustainable levels. Even with last week’s pullback, the Nasdaq is up more than 70% from its March bottom. 
“Given how extreme many of the indicators we follow had become by early this past week, we believe it will take more than just a mild decline to work off those conditions,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said in a note on Sunday. “Therefore we still believe a correction of more than 10% is probable.”
Maley pointed to the extreme overbought conditions in some of the mega-cap tech names as well as the elevated valuation levels for the S&P 500.

"As Nasdaq sell-off continues, analysts say next leg of bull market could look different",EST-20208:49-PM,"Pfizer
said Monday that it has a vaccine that is more than 90% successful in preventing Covid-19, and it could be broadly available next year. A vaccine would help the economy return to normal, and people would again be comfortable gathering in public, traveling and going into offices, schools and retail stores.
“I think this is going to have some legs and will persist well into next year,” said QMA chief investment strategist Ed Keon of the rotation.
“It’s hard to say for sure, but I think this is the beginning of a reset, not that there won’t be moves back towards the stocks that have been working,” said Keon. “I think we might be moving toward a more balanced market. If things go smoothly and a vaccine is available, I think you’ll see things that got beaten up by the pandemic will return to more normal prices and more normal earnings. The things that got boosted by the pandemic will return to earth.”
Binky Chadha, chief U.S. equity and global strategist at Deutsche Bank said he’s been neutral on Nasdaq big tech for awhile. “Positive news on the vaccine should not be about the market going up or down,” he said. “The market is fully priced for 60 ISM which is what we got. All I’m saying was the market was fully priced for a very rapid, much more rapid economic recovery.” The ISM manufacturing report for October came in at 59.3, the highest level since September, 2018.
“There are a lot of good reasons for optimism here with respect to the economy. Just as in 2020, people said the stock market is different than the economy, and the stock market was going up... now it can be in reverse,” said Boockvar. “The economy may be better next year, and the stock market may not rally.”
The bifurcated trading drove the Dow
higher, up 0.9%, but hit Nasdaq
, down 1.4%. The S&P 500
was down 0.1%, but the small cap Russell 2000
was up 1.8%.
Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com, said it’s difficult to say how deep the sell-off in growth will go. “Typically, so far this year there’s been two or three bouts of this. Where it’s only been two down days for tech... usually it repairs and becomes fine again,” said Redler. “That’s the question. Is this time different? It’s hard to tell. Tech has enjoyed multiple years of outperformance and gains.”
Redler, who follows short term technicals, said the damage done this week to the charts of tech and growth names is worse than some of the prior moves.
Redler said he is watching Apple
for leadership for tech, and on Tuesday afternoon it closed just slightly lower, off 0.3% at $116 per share. “Tech lost momentum and is bending. You can’t say it’s broken yet , but it’s definitely vulnerable,” he said. Redler said the market can’t go up that much without tech participating.
“Now tech is actually a headwind and it needs to find a level where it can base, so it doesn’t remain a headwind...Two days don’t make a trend, but if you’re overweight a sector, it can hurt you,” said Redler.
Stocks like Microsoft
, Tesla,
Alphabet
all traded lower, but names like Caterpillar,
Boeing
and Honeywell
all moved higher.
“These are all great companies but valuations may not be able to sustain themselves,” said Boockvar. He said the market is trading at about 22 times earnings, but the big tech names are all trading at over 30 times or more trailing earnings .
Amazon is trading at about 89 times trailing earnings, while Zoom was at more than 500 times trailing earnings but 150 times fiscal 2021 earnings.
Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives trading at BTIG, said he is cautious on the market, particularly Nasdaq names.
“The combination of political uncertainty and the virus leaves us cautious on further near-term market gains, yet resolutely optimistic long-term,” Emanuel wrote. Because of Nasdaq’s divergence, Emanuel is recommending investors protect gains by buying puts on the QQQ ETF
, which represents the Nasdaq 100.
Emanuel also said the economy is at risk of “scarring,” a concern mentioned by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
“Given the virus’ parabolic increase – 10M total U.S. cases, the 5-day average over 100K – coordinated national public health policy, including stimulus, likely needs urgent implementation prior to 1/20/21 to avoid a 4Q/1Q recession,” Emanuel wrote.
He said it’s possible the election uncertainty, combined with the vaccine news and better economic reports, like Friday’s jobs report, could result in inaction from Congress. Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, but President Donald Trump claims he won and his campaign is contesting the counts in several states.
UBS Global Wealth Management told clients to diversify into the cyclical areas of the market.
“The market reaction underlines our recent message that investors need to diversify for the next leg of the rally, toward more cyclical parts of the market that have lagged behind in 2020, and away from big tech and the primary stay-at-home beneficiaries,” wrote Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele. “We have said that the next leg up in stocks would be driven by an end to US political uncertainty and sustainable mobility gains backed by a vaccine. Developments in the past week support our view.”“The stock market is two stock markets. You have tech and everything else. Everything else is finally getting their day,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Tech and the whole work from home world is a whole different place today [following] that Pfizer news. The use of Zoom is not going to be that prevalent if you go back to the office. I think this is real and this could be the end of the growth dominance of the market in this cycle.”The sell-off in big cap growth and tech may not be just a quick washout in high-priced names.
It could be a reset for the stock market.

Leon Cooperman says new bull market isn’t coming anytime soon, but he’s finding cheap stocks to buyTechnology shares were under pressure Wednesday as rising rates discount the value of future earnings and therefore can hit growth stocks particularly hard. Advanced Micro Devices pulled back about 6.1%, Nvidia retreated 3.9% and Google-parent Alphabet dipped 2%.
Meanwhile, bank stocks got a lift from the jump in bond yields, capping losses for the overall market. Higher rates mean banks charge greater interest on loans, which typically boosts profits. Bank of America ticked up nearly 0.8% and Wells Fargo gained 0.9%.
Investors also looked outside of stocks and bonds for inflation hedges. Gold and bitcoin rose as investors sought assets that could hold up better as prices rise.The consumer price index jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones and the largest annual increase since 1990. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate. The CPI is a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents.
“Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index showed another month of inflation data well above the Federal Reserve’s inflation target, primarily due to continued supply chain issues and labor shortages. If inflation doesn’t subside, the Federal Reserve may need to taper at a more substantial rate and hike interest rates, which could hurt stocks and bonds,” Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management, said.
Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central bank’s first full rate hike coming in July 2022.Data is unavailable
Please contact cnbc support to provide details about what went wrongStocks retreated Wednesday after October’s consumer price reading showing the biggest annual jump in more than 30 years, triggering a spike in bond yields.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 240.04 points, or about 0.7%, to close at 36,079.94. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 4,646.71. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped nearly 1.7% to 15,622.71.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which had trended lower in recent weeks, jumped by about 11 basis points Wednesday after the CPI reading. (1 basis point is 0.01 percentage points.) A poor auction in 30-year bonds that afternoon added steam to the spike.
As Treasury yields surged, investors dumped high-flying technology stocks and bid up bank stocks. They also sought refuge in gold and bitcoin.

Nasdaq stocks led by Tesla continue their blistering run while chill envelops rest of the market,EDT-202011:06-AM,"Back in the late ’90s, the market was implicitly over-extrapolating massive growth rates for many years in companies more cyclical than appreciated, such as Cisco Systems and Intel (along with Microsoft, Oracle, Yahoo and other graybeards of Silicon Valley).
There is an unusual situation now in which the tech darlings have been barreling higher largely on macro fears and heavy liquidity flows rather than product hype or Wall Street salesmanship. In fact, the consensus analyst price targets for Apple, Microsoft and Amazon are all below the stocks’ current quote, according to FactSet.
Does this show a helpfully cautious analytical corps serially underestimating today’s best companies — a sturdy wall of worry built by Wall Street itself? Or is it a sign the market has carried them beyond even the sell side’s typically rosy calculus of fundamental value?
Who knows, Friday’s mean-reversion action, with banks, energy and small caps retaking a sliver of the territory dominated by tech, is the start of a rebalancing of the market. The levitation in secular-growth sectors has arguably been the market’s way of deploying ample liquidity to stay supported as the country backslides on Covid containment and the economy fitfully tries to recover.
It’s tough to deny that big chunks of the Nasdaq are in the sway of overheated speculation. Tesla
, to take the obvious example, has gained $108 billion in market value in two weeks. More than $34 billion worth of the stock traded on Friday alone, twice the turnover that day in Amazon – a company whose market cap is more than five times as large.
This is fevered, heedless action, feeding on itself and punishing the disciplined. And the more it goes on or spreads to other stocks, the harder it will become to make the case that this is a market unappreciated by a skeptical investing public.SentimenTrader.com notes that about three-quarters of Nasdaq stocks are above their 200-day moving average, the shorthand definition of a longer-term uptrend, while only about 40% of S&P 500 names are in that position. This gap in breadth is either rare or unprecedented:
The Nasdaq 100 has pushed more than 22% above its 200-day average, according to Baycrest Partners’ Jonathan Krinsky, the most extreme spread with the index at a high since 2000.
And the S&P tech sector has returned to its peak price-to-sales ratio from the March 2000 tech-bubble market top.

For sure, today’s tech companies are more profitable than those of two decades ago. And while the five largest S&P 500 stocks are all from the Nasdaq and in the tech or Internet realms (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook) now make up a 20-year high 21% of the S&P 500, they also kick in a commensurate portion of the index’s free cash flow, as this breakdown from Fred Alger Management shows.
 And as wild as the Nasdaq’s surge and outperformance have been, it simply hasn’t piled up the amount of easy riches that it had in the late-’90s run. In the five and ten years through the end of 1999, the Nasdaq Composite had gained 440% and 800%, respectively. The comparable gains over the past five and ten years: up 111% and 380%.
Admittedly, arguing that the current market is not as expensive, frothy or beloved as the most overvalued, overextended and overestimated market in many decades is not exactly a ringing endorsement. And indeed we may never see a close rerun of that period. But, as argued here a few weeks ago, stocks can be stoutly valued and priced for subpar future returns without representing an unstable bubble or dangerous misallocation of capital.
Another qualitative distinction between today’s outsized Nasdaq contribution to the market’s climb and the one that culminated 20 years and four months ago: The crowding into the mega-cap elite names today is a defensive instinct, investors gravitating toward steadiness and predictability rather than blue-sky hopes of galloping growth rates and innovative disruption to come. As long as corporate-debt yields remain so low and cash-flow streams are seen as very scarce, what might upend this part of the market beyond nasty short-term corrections and shakeouts.The crucial question swirling around the Nasdaq’s ascent and refusal of the Big Six stocks to take anything but a quick rest for months is whether investors are in danger of overpaying for the perceived certainty of secure cash flows, durable growth and entrenched franchises in the digital economy.
There is no denying both that the Nasdaq complex in the short-term appears technically stretched and over-loved, while large-cap tech is getting richly valued.This stock market is like the old line about having one foot in a bucket of scalding water and the other in a bucket of ice, netting out to a neutral, if not comfortable, temperature.
There’s the blistering Nasdaq
, with its unassailable technology gatekeepers and a combustible frenzy in Tesla
stealing much of the market’s oxygen. Then there’s the chill enveloping smaller stocks, vestiges of the physical consumer economy and legacy financial institutions.

Coinbase gets reference price of $250 per share from Nasdaq ahead of today’s direct listing,EDT-20217:14-AM,"For the full year of 2020, revenue more than doubled to $1.28 billion, and the company swung from a loss in 2019 to a profit of $322.3 million.
Coinbase has mapped out a plan to be at the center of an emerging “cryptoeconomy,” in which financial transactions and online marketplaces will largely move to the blockchain, giving investors a wide set of digital currencies to buy and trade. But the company has acknowledged that short-term growth will primarily be dictated by the price and transaction volume of bitcoin.
WATCH: Crypto strategist on how Coinbase’s debut validates cryptocurrenciesNasdaq gave Coinbase a reference price of $250 a share ahead of Wednesday’s planned direct listing, which would value the cryptocurrency exchange at about $65.3 billion on a fully diluted basis.
Coinbase is set to become the first major crypto business to go public in the U.S. and, should it reach a $100 billion market cap, will instantly be one of the country’s 85 most valuable companies. The company’s value has soared in the past year alongside bitcoin and ethereum, the primary currencies traded on the site.
Coinbase chose the direct listing path to the public market rather than pursuing a traditional IPO. That means instead of raising cash by selling new shares to a group of institutional investors, Coinbase is allowing existing stakeholders start selling immediately at a market-driven price.
The reference price provided by Nasdaq reflects recent private market trades and input from investment bankers but does not indicate where the stock will open. This is Nasdaq’s first major direct listing. In the five significant direct listings that have taken place on the New York Stock Exchange — Spotify
, Slack
, Palantir
, Asana
and Roblox
— the opening price was on average about 37% above the reference price.
If Coinbase opens with a similar percentage increase, the price would be around $343, very close to the average private market price in the first quarter of $343.58.
Coinbase said last week in announcing preliminary first-quarter results that revenue in the period surged ninefold to $1.8 billion, and net income climbed to between $730 million and $800 million from $32 million a year earlier. The vast majority of transactions on Coinbase involve the purchasing of bitcoin and ethereum, which have been on a historic tear, climbing over 800% and 1,300%, respectively, in the past year.Coinbase is set to become the first major crypto business to go public in the U.S. and, should it reach a $100 billion market cap, will instantly be one of the country’s 85 most valuable companies.

"Op-ed: Rethinking stock benchmarks as tech-heavy Nasdaq outpaces S&P 500, Dow",EDT-202010:55-AM,"Source: FactSet 
The Nasdaq composite weight in technology is 48% and adding the three largest communications services names in the top 10 (Facebook, Google, and Netflix), brings that total to 75%.  The performance of its largest components has caused investors to fixate on this index as a bellwether for opportunities in the market.
If the Nasdaq has risen in importance, has the S&P 500 lost relevance?  It’s happened before:  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the universal benchmark for most money managers until the 1980′s, when it was replaced by the broader S&P.  (The Dow made major changes Monday night to stay relevant.)
The drawbacks of the Dow, which is still cited by the media, were clear – there were only 30 companies; the higher priced stocks carried the most weight; the process of adding and deleted constituents was opaque; and, there was very little nod to technology as the greatest catalyst to the US economy.  Even by 2012, only four of the 30 Dow names were tech firms.  
What would be the rationale for changing our benchmark from the S&P to the Nasdaq?  If stock prices reflect earnings growth now or in the future, there is no question that the Nasdaq, with the dominance of technology, digital platform businesses, and biotechnology, grows faster.  However, because of the inclusion of so many pre-profit companies, the gap is less than expected, with the 10-year cumulative earnings per share expansion at 91.4% for the NDX and 52.7% for the S&P.  Far more impressive is the price appreciation from 2010 until July 30, 2020 of 569% versus 265% for the S&P 500.  
If switching benchmarks means more exposure to faster growing earnings and superior stock performance than the S&P, what could be wrong with that?
Actually, a few things.  For one, the Nasdaq is more concentrated than we prefer – Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet – account for just under 51% of the entire index.  In the S&P 500, where these names hold the same rank positions, their weight is currently less than half that amount (~23%).  To outperform the Nasdaq, when these stocks are charging forward, many managers would be tempted to allocate at least half the portfolio to them.
That implies more risk appetite than clients may be aware they are taking.  When those key stocks retreat, look out.  That level of risk requires a strong stomach for both the managers and their clients.
The S&P 500 index criteria are more demanding, ensuring a level of valuation support not inherent in its counterpart. It includes the 500 largest companies by market cap, assuming they meet other conditions. 
For example, the most recent quarter and the addition of the last four quarters must show positive income, and 50% of the outstanding shares must float publicly.  There is no profitability requirement for the Nasdaq and there are no share liquidity rules.   
While the Nasdaq Tech Sector, plus AMZN, FB, GOOGL and NFLX accounts for 75% of the index, that same grouping applied to the S&P 500 stands at 39% (27.5% Tech sector and 11.2% for the other stocks.)  The remaining 61% of the S&P represent the biggest companies in all other sectors, which can be overlooked if benchmarked to the Nasdaq.
Weights adjust, as they should, based on share price driven by anticipated profitability.  At the end of 2010, the S&P Energy weight was 11.9%, with both its revenues and profits accounting for 13% the total for the index.  Today, Energy, hit by weak oil prices, excess supply, and divestment, holds a 2.5% weight, accounting for only 1.2% of net income. 
Other sectors, such as Consumer Staples, Industrials, and Materials have fallen in prominence, impacted by evolving brand stature, globalization, and technology, while Tech, Communications Services (a newly-named grouping that combined elements of three former sectors), and Consumer Discretionary have grown with the rise of digital media, online shopping, and the technologies impacting consumer and business behavior.  Technology, while the most profitable sector, still only represents 10% of the S&P 500 revenues, 18.5% of its profits, and 12% of its employees. 
In searching for the best opportunities, we need to scour the investment universe across all market capitalizations and industries, including some very small Nasdaq-listed stocks.  However, if we to re-focus our attention on beating the Nasdaq, there is a risk we might ignore the very wide potential embedded in health care, consumer, financials (still the largest sector by net income) and other groups well represented in our index. 
I’ll put that idea to bed.
Karen Firestone is Chairman, CEO, and co-founder of Aureus Asset Management, an investment firm dedicated to providing contemporary asset management to families, individuals and institutions. A few weeks ago, two things happened which made me wonder whether we, meaning the management of the investment firm I co-founded, are deluding ourselves in continuing to compare our performance to the S&P 500 index.  Honestly, we have never considered any other benchmark, as the S&P has represented, to us and our investors, a diversified portrait of the U.S. economy.  However, perhaps we needed to rethink that premise.  
First, several friends asked me if they should buy the same stock, Tesla. To call Tesla
a strong performer is an understatement (It’s up 377% this year)... It combines brashness, innovation (sustainable!!), and a product that everyone can describe (a CAR!!) into one shiny package. 
Second, were some comments by clients, highlighting the wonderful results of other managers (not us), whose extremely tech-heavy portfolios, were beating us by a decent margin, even though we thought we were doing very well against our benchmark, the S&P.  As one client noted, most of these dynamite stocks, such as Facebook, Twilio, Zoom, Netflix, Teledoc, and Shopify, didn’t exist before 2000.  Neither did Tesla.
At first, I saw no clear connection between friends eager to catch the momentum and the idea that a new “market” had emerged.  Upon further reflection, I realized that the Covid experience had indelibly impacted investors. Veterans and novices alike have recognized the tremendous reward in stocks whose success relies on novel applications of technology where the demand has grown, not diminished, during the pandemic.
Tesla fits that description perfectly, a cult stock for years, whose futuristic innovations are packaged in a product everyone understands - (IT’S A CLEAN-ENERGY CAR), at a time when no one is flying, just driving.
Those winning stocks populate the Nasdaq Composite Index more completely than the S&P 500.  While the S&P has roared back more than 50% from the lows in March, the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 60%.  Those windfalls have not been evenly distributed.  The COVID-proof or COVID-helped companies, such as the ones mentioned above, plus behemoths like Amazon, Apple, PayPal, and, of course, Tesla, all trade exclusively on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while laggards such as banks, airlines, retail, and energy are more likely to trade on the New York Stock Exchange."
AST SpaceMobile shares rise as the space SPAC stock begins trading on the Nasdaq,EDT-20214:04-PM,"AST SpaceMobile, based in Midland, Texas, is building a network of satellites, also known as a constellation, that is designed to deliver broadband from space directly to consumer smartphones.
Existing satellite networks require additional physical devices to connect to the service, such as Iridium’s
 mobile satellite phones or SpaceX’s Starlink user terminals. The satellite communications market has become increasingly crowded, however, with new services from the likes of OneWeb, Telesat, and Lockheed Martin’s
 recent partnership with space-based 5G startup Omnispace.
“We don’t see the other satellite [low Earth Orbit] constellations like Starlink as a competitor. Actually, we think that is a great thing they are happening, as they lower the cost of launch and they make space more affordable, basically, to the masses,” AST chairman and CEO Abel Avellan told CNBC’s Morgan Brennan on Wednesday.
The company, which raised about $120 million in private capital before the SPAC deal, expects to add about $462 million in total proceeds from the merger. The new capital will fund the company’s development of its network, with AST planning to launch its next demonstration satellite BlueWalker 3 later this year. Avellan said AST expects to “soon” announce launch contracts with multiple rocket companies to deliver its satellites to orbit.
“It’s a long term opportunity ... but it’s a very very large opportunity in a very large addressable market,” Avellan said.
The close of AST’s deal comes as the first among a recent series of space SPACs. Including AST, seven space companies have announced SPAC mergers in the past six months.Shares of satellite-to-smartphone broadband company AST SpaceMobile

Six tech stocks now make up half the value of the Nasdaq 100,EDT-20208:30-AM,"Microsoft and Tesla are set to report quarterly results Wednesday afternoon. Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all follow next week. Heading into earnings season, the Nasdaq 100 is trading at about 30 times forward earnings, the highest since 2004, according to FactSet. Its multiple to revenue is at the highest since 2002.
Outside of the the top six stocks, the companies that have had the biggest impact on the Nasdaq 100 this year are Nvidia
, PayPal
, Zoom
and Netflix
, which are up 52% (Netflix) to 284% (Zoom). Moderna
has been the next biggest contributor, on optimism that the biotech company will successfully develop a Covid-19 vaccine. The stock is up 320% for the year.
Despite their huge gains, those five companies combined make up just 6.9% of the Nasdaq 100. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are each over 11% of the index.
WATCH: Stocks rise as Amazon leads tech - three investors on how to invest nowIt’s not just the Nasdaq 100 — the concentration of market cap in the biggest tech companies is skewing all the cap-weighted indexes. The S&P 500 gets 22% of its value from five of those companies, up from 17.5% just six months ago. (Tesla isn’t included because it hasn’t yet met the index’s requirement for profitability.)
The six now make up almost 41% of the Nasdaq, which has more than 2,700 member companies.
The Nasdaq 100 claims on its website that it has “strength in diversity” and says that diversity “has been critical to the index’s strong performance and success over the past two decades.” It has beaten the S&P 500 10 of the past 11 years and, over the past decade, the Nasdaq 100 is up 496%, versus 205% for the S&P 500 and 388% for the Nasdaq Composite.
While there may be diversity among the components of the index, the concentration at the top is greater than at any of its major index peers. That leaves investors in the Nasdaq 100 particularly susceptible to earnings that will be coming out over the next week.Investors in the Nasdaq 100 will be paying particularly close attention to earnings from the top tech companies starting Wednesday afternoon.
Whether looking at this year’s stock market action, or its performance over a one-year, three-year, five-year or 10-year stretch, the Nasdaq 100 has outperformed the broader Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500.

Nasdaq proposal would require greater diversity on company boards,EST-20204:25-PM,"Nasdaq is pushing for greater diversity among the more than 3,000 companies listed on its exchange.
The exchange operator filed a proposal Tuesday asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve new listing rules surrounding the makeup of companies’ boards of directors, as well as greater transparency around who fills the seats in the boardroom.
Under the proposal, the majority of companies will be required to have at least two diverse board directors: one woman and one person who identifies as either an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ. If a company cannot meet these requirements, it will not be delisted, but it will need to explain why it cannot satisfy the goals. Failure to publish board data, however, could result in delisting.
Should the SEC approve the plan, all companies would have to disclose board-level diversity statistics within one year of the policy being passed. Nasdaq said in a statement that the time frame for companies to meet the board requirements will depend on each company’s listing tier, but that all companies will be expected to have at least one diverse director within two years of the SEC’s approval.
“Disclosure is really the foundation of our markets and our economy,” Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “We rely on companies to make full and accurate disclosures to inform investors so that investors can make their own decisions as to which companies they want to invest in and what they expect of the companies where they’re an investor.”
More than 75% of the exchange’s roughly 3,200 companies do not meet the criteria, according to a New York Times story citing data from Nasdaq
The push from Nasdaq — the first exchange that has called for the implementation of diversity requirements — comes amid a boom in so-called ESG investing — when a company’s environmental, social and governance factors are evaluated. With ESG funds seeing record inflows, companies are taking note. In January, Goldman Sachs announced that it will not take companies public without “at least one diverse board candidate.”
Nasdaq’s proposal follows countless studies touting the benefits of greater diversity at the board level and throughout companies more broadly. In a 2019 study McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile of gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to experience above-average profitability compared with companies in the bottom quartile.
“We are taking the leadership here because there has been so little action on this front and we do think it’s an important thing for us to do — to create a more inclusive capitalist society and we think this is a step forward,” Friedman said.Nasdaq is pushing for greater diversity among the more than 3,000 companies listed on its exchange.

I think we’ve had a room clearing out there, so to speak,” Mills said. “On the flip side, you look at the Amazons of the world, and a lot of those charts have gone sideways for the better part of six months.”

The session’s gains came after Wall Street enjoyed its best week in months as investors grew more confident the current inflation in the U.S. is not a sustained economic threat, but a temporary uptick. The S&P 500 finished the week at a record high, while the Nasdaq added 2.35% in the five-day period.
The weekly gains came even after the Commerce Department reported that its inflation indicator rose 3.4% in May, the fastest increase since the early 1990s.
Spikes in the core personal consumption expenditures price index can cause heartburn for investors since the Federal Reserve likes to watch it for signs of inflation. Still, the month-over-month rise actually undershot what economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast and reinforced for investors that the economy-wide price increases are likely to be transient and manageable.
A massive, bipartisan infrastructure deal appeared revitalized as of Sunday evening after President Joe Biden clarified on Saturday that he doesn’t plan to veto the legislation if it comes without a separate reconciliation bill favored by Democrats. Republican senators then said on Sunday that the deal can move forward.
“The bipartisan infrastructure agreement hammered out in Washington DC last week appears to stand some chance of becoming a reality,” wrote John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, in a note. “This program could serve the country near and longer term in generating job creation, boost economic growth, underpin corporate revenue and earnings growth and increase the ability of the US to compete with other nations in the still relatively new but hypercompetitive 21st Century.”
The next major piece of economic data is the June jobs report, which the Labor Department is scheduled to publish on Friday.
Economists are expecting that nonfarm payrolls increased by 683,000 in June. While such a robust reading would top the 559,000 in May, it would still be below the 1 million some had hoped a recovering U.S. economy could post as it emerged from the Covid-19 crisis.
Investors will also pore over the June report for any signs of wage inflation as employers struggle to find workers to fill job openings and pandemic-era jobless benefits taper off in some states.

Confluent’s software tracks the many events taking place inside a company, whether it’s a new sale, an order, a trade or a customer response, and filters those real-time insights into a company’s databases. As businesses have become more complex, with data living in various clouds and in on-premises servers, demand has surged for Confluent’s so-called data streaming products.
Revenue climbed 58% last year to $236.8 million, according to the prospectus. However, research and development costs jumped 81% and stock-based compensation soared, leading to a net loss of $229.8 million, up from $95 million in 2019.
Confluent is built on Apache Kafka, an open source technology that was created inside LinkedIn in 2011 by Jay Kreps, Jun Rao and Neha Narkhede. After using the technology internally for data streams, the trio spun out Confluent as a separate company in 2014 with an investment of about $500,000 from LinkedIn.
While Kafka remains a free open-source product that can be managed as a service by Amazon
, Microsoft
or Google
, Confluent commercializes the software, offering all of its capabilities and running it across any of the major clouds or in a company’s physical data center.
Kreps told CNBC’s “TechCheck” that the cloud providers are partners more than competitors.
“One of the reasons they like working with us is because we help connect all these new layers that are in the cloud into a lot of the data that exists in other clouds or on premise,” Kreps said. “Really tying that together around a central nervous system is a huge problem that companies have to face.”
Confluent said in its prospectus that more than 70% of Fortune 500 companies are estimated to have used Kafka. Its customers include Citigroup
, Humana
, Intel
 and Walmart
, according to Confluent’s website.
Confluent is the latest company built on open-source technology that’s gotten big enough to go public. Database platform MongoDB
debuted in 2017 and is now valued at $24 billion. Elastic
, which commercializes open source tools for enterprise search, went public a year later and has a market cap of $13 billion. Databricks sells software built on Apache Spark, helping companies clean up large volumes of data. The company was valued at $28 billion in a private financing round in February.
The model hasn’t always worked for public investors. Cloudera, one of several companies that focused on the Apache Hadoop data analytics framework, agreed to sell to private equity firms earlier this month in a $5.3 billion deal. Cloudera merged with rival Hortonworks in 2019, as both companies were burning cash and their stocks were dropping.
Even after the tie-up, Cloudera continued to struggle, primarily because it was late to the cloud market, where Databricks has flourished.
At Thursday’s close, Kreps owns a stake worth $1.3 billion. Venture firm Benchmark is the biggest investor with shares worth close to $1.6 billion, followed by Index Ventures, whose stake is valued at about $1.3 billion.

"The Nasdaq has ‘a lot of unwind’ left to go as tech stocks sell off, says chart analyst",EDT-20202:29-PM,"(This story is for CNBC Pro subscribers only.)
The Nasdaq Composite’
s sell-off Thursday could be the beginning of a more significant pullback for the tech-heavy index, according to technical analyst Jonathan Krinsky.

Nasdaq to buy financial fraud detection firm Verafin for $2.75 billion,EST-20208:13-AM,"Exchange operator Nasdaq
said on Thursday it would buy anti-financial crime software firm Verafin for $2.75 billion in cash, significantly expanding its reach in the regulatory technology market.
Verafin, founded in 2003, provides more than 2,000 financial institutions in North America a cloud-based platform to help detect, investigate, and report money laundering and financial fraud.
Nasdaq will aim to provide Verafin’s technology to the 250 banks, exchanges, broker-dealers and buy-side organizations, and regulatory authorities, that use its trade surveillance systems, the company said.
With the deal, the exchange group is doubling down on its push into the anti-money laundering software sector and furthering its strategy of repositioning the company as a leading financial technology and data vendor.
While Nasdaq is best known for operating exchanges in the United States and globally, it is also a provider of market technology to banks and other financial institutions.
It has a strong foothold in the trade surveillance software market, as well as in the trading technology systems sector. It made its first move in the anti-money laundering software market in September when it launched artificial intelligence technology to help retail and commercial banks automate investigations.
“The problem of detecting money laundering and fraud hasn’t been solved very well yet,” Valerie Bannert-Thurner, senior vice president and head of sell-side and buy-side solutions, market technology at Nasdaq, said in an interview. “With our acquisition, we are doubling down on our belief this as an area that is being disrupted and where we can have a big impact.”
Nasdaq’s push comes as banks and other financial firms look to automate many of their more expensive and complex back-office processes to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
This includes compliance and surveillance functions, where costs have been growing significantly following tougher regulatory crackdowns over the past decade.
Still, up to $2 trillion is laundered globally each year, representing up to 5% of global GDP, according to the United Nations.
The acquisition marks another milestone in Nasdaq’s effort to diversify its revenue stream away from trading, where fees have been declining, into areas such as technology and data.
Nasdaq’s revenues from its market technology and investment intelligence businesses have grown 54% since 2016, and non-trading revenues represent 73% of the group’s overall revenues.
The deal is Nasdaq’s largest since its $3.8 billion purchase of Nordic exchange OMX in 2008.
Nasdaq will finance the transaction, which will add to its earnings per share beginning in 2022, with a combination of $2.5 billion of debt and cash on hand.Exchange operator Nasdaq said on Thursday it would buy anti-financial crime management products firm Verafin for $2.75 billion in cash.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq slip from their records ahead of key Fed meeting,EDT-20214:31-PM,"U.S. stocks fell slightly on Tuesday with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite slipping from their respective records, as investors awaited the key Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting.
The S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 4,246.59 after rising 0.1% to reach a new all-time high of 4,257.16 earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.42 points, or about 0.3%, to 34,299.33. The Nasdaq Composite, which hit a record closing high in the previous session, pulled back 0.7% to 14,072.86 as Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft all registered losses.
Real estate and tech were the biggest laggards on Tuesday, while the energy sector provided the broader market with some support, rising 2.1%. Diamondback Energy jumped 5.1%, and Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum climbed more than 3% each.
On the data front, the final demand index for producer prices advanced 6.6% for the 12 months ended in May, the largest increase since 12-month data were first calculated in November 2010.
On a monthly basis, the producer price index for final demand rose 0.8%, ahead of the Dow Jones estimate of 0.6%.
Meanwhile, May’s retail sales data fell 1.3%, compared to an expectation of a 0.7% decline per economists polled by Dow Jones.
“The mixed data hasn’t raised any eyebrows in the market,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. “The market has barely responded with few brave enough to take big positions ahead of tomorrow’s Fed announcement. The big question is whether the Fed will start, very slowly, introducing taper talk and the debate surrounding reining in ultra-lose monetary policy.”
The Fed’s two-day policy meeting started on Tuesday, and it’s a focal point for the markets this week. The central bank is not expected to take any action. However, commentary on interest rates, inflation and the economy could drive market moves.
Traders will listen closely for comments on inflation and the Fed’s eventual tapering plans.
“The longer they wait to talk, let alone launch taper, imbalances grow,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG. “Taper risks plus recent high inflation data and issues around RRP/IOER rate will likely make this the last meeting the Fed can be dovish.”
Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones told CNBC on Monday that this Fed meeting could be the most important in Chairman Jerome Powell’s career. Tudor Jones also warned that Powell could spark a big sell-off in risk assets if he doesn’t do a good job of signaling a taper in the Fed’s monthly asset buying.

"Nasdaq rises to an all-time closing high, S&P 500 ekes out another record",EDT-20214:16-PM,"The Nasdaq Composite jumped to a record high on Monday as investors rotated back into growth-oriented stocks ahead of a key Federal Reserve meeting.
The tech-heavy benchmark rose 0.7% to an all-time closing high of 14,174.14, overtaking the previous record on April 26. The S&P 500 gained about 0.2% to another record close 4,255.15, boosted by the technology sector. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 85.85 points, or nearly 0.3%, to 34,393,75.
Investors are giving growth and tech stocks another chance as bond yields come down. The 10-year Treasury fell below 1.43% on Friday, a three-month low. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation, an ETF that focuses on disruptive technology, returned about 6% last week. The fund rose 1.9% Monday even as the benchmark Treasury yield rose briefly back to 1.5%. Apple and Netflix both jumped more than 2%, while Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook also registered gains.
Boosting cryptocurrency sentiment, Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Sunday said the company will resume bitcoin transactions once it confirms there is reasonable clean energy usage by miners. Bitcoin recovered back above $40,000 Monday. Tesla, a big holder of bitcoin, climbed nearly 1.3%.
“The broad market’s modest performance is pretty much in line with historical patterns— specifically, June’s tendency for generally quiet trading,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E-Trade Financial. “As the market continues to sort through potential moves made by the Fed and looming inflation, we could continue to see this narrative play out in the short-term.”
The Fed’s two-day policy meeting will likely dominate investor behavior this week. Although the central bank is not expected to take any action, its forecasts for interest rates, inflation and the economy could move the markets. The Fed could possibly move up its forecast for a rate hike after saying in its last quarterly update that it would keep its benchmark rate near zero through 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak to the press after the central bank issues its statement Wednesday. Traders will be parsing his comments for any clues as to when the Fed could start to end its aggressive monthly asset purchases, especially given recent hotter-than-expected inflation readings.
Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said this week’s Fed meeting could be the most important in Powell’s career, and he warned that the chairman could spark a big sell-off in risk assets if he doesn’t do a good job of signaling a taper.
“If they course correct, if they say, ‘We’ve got incoming data, we’ve accomplished our mission or we’re on the way very rapidly to accomplishing our mission on employment,’ then you’re going to get a taper tantrum,” Tudor Jones said. “You’re going to get a sell-off in fixed income. You’re going to get a correction in stocks.”
U.S. stocks ended last week with a record closing high for the S&P 500 and the beginning of a rotation back into growth names.
Last week, the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, but the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, for its third straight positive week. The Nasdaq Composite was the outperformer with a gain of nearly 1.9%, posting its fourth winning week in a row as the tech trade came back into favor.

"Market bull Jeremy Siegel warns the Nasdaq rebound will unravel, favors value stocks",EST-20212:48-PM,"The Nasdaq rebound may last shorter than a New York minute.
Wharton School finance professor Jeremy Siegel sees near-term trouble, saying the backdrop dramatically supports the reopening trade over Big Tech and growth plays.
“I’ve been extremely bullish here for nine months,” he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday. “This stock market still has a way to go up.”
But his forecast excludes the tech-heavy Nasdaq
, which just returned to positive territory for the year. The index surged 3.6% on Tuesday. Last week, it was in correction territory.
Siegel warns challenges associated with higher interest rates and optimism surrounding economic reopenings will continue to weigh on growth trades.
“I don’t think they’re going to do badly. We’re not going to have a crash like we had 20 years ago at all,” he said. “But I think the outperformers are going to be basically non-tech over the next six to 12 months.”
In this environment, Siegel prefers groups positioned to profit as rates rise.
“The so-called value stocks are going to be sought out for their yield because I think interest rates are still going to be headed much higher here on the long bond
,” he added. “I don’t think we’re done with this rise in these long-term interest rates.”
Siegel is reiterating his 2021 epic “bounce back” forecast. He still believes the Dow
will hit 35,000 this year, a 10% rise from Tuesday’s record close.
“This is just going to be the hottest economy we’re going to see in a long time,” Siegel said.

"Time to add to Tesla shares in latest Nasdaq sell-off, trader says",EST-202112:45-PM,"The Nasdaq
sell-off continued on Friday, its fourth day in decline.
The tech-heavy index has fallen victim to rising rates, which makes the high-growth stocks the Nasdaq is known for less attractive to investors. The more concentrated Nasdaq 100
is pacing for a 4% weekly decline.
Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, put on a hedge trade using options last week. He said it makes sense to stick with this strategy to weather any more downside.
“The technology market as well as the broader indexes have sold off. ... I think there’s more room to go, and the way I’m using this is I am, with my clients, hedging using options, so I want to leave the hedge on,” Gordon told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday.
Tracking the two prior declines, Gordon said this sell-off is likely to follow a two-step pattern or three-wave correction, where the XLK technology ETF
falls, makes a lower high in a countertrend rally and then a lower low.
“That winds up being a good buying opportunity,” said Gordon. “If we go down, rally back up and then make an equal leg move down, again that’s pretty common, support might be viewed around $125 in XLK.”
The ETF, which holds Apple
and Microsoft
among its major components, was trading at around $126 on Friday.
Tesla
, which is not in the XLK but often caught up in tech sell-offs, is one name Gordon is looking to add on the downside. He said investors could buy shares outright or use the options market. One strategy he laid out involves selling a 635 put and buying a 725 call with April expiration.
“If Tesla starts to move up towards these old highs around $730, what you can do is just simply close out the put, take the profits, exercise the call, and then you will have been paid about $33 a share to accumulate 100 shares of Tesla. That’s one way you can do it,” he said.
Disclosure: Todd Gordon holds shares of Tesla.

"Why Dow may be safer bet than the Nasdaq right now, according to recent market history",EDT-20204:08-PM,"Some prominent investors are worried about ceilings in these tech stock values, and the market more broadly. Speaking Wednesday on CNBC’s “Halftime Report,” billionaire hedge fund investor David Tepper said the stock market is one of the most overpriced he’s ever seen, only behind 1999, and he said Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet may be “fully valued.”
On the last day of the six-straight gainers for the Nasdaq, on Monday, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all rose more than 1%, posting their sixth consecutive day of gains. 
“The market is pretty high, and the Fed has put a lot of money in here,” the founder of Appaloosa Management said. “There’s been different misallocation of capital in the markets. Certainly you are seeing pockets of that now in the stock market. The market is by anybody’s standard pretty full.”
Some investing icons say the market outlook all comes down to the public health response success or failure. 
“There’ll be a shift in focus from liquidity issues somewhere down the line to solvency issues. If we don’t find a vaccine or a cure, if we don’t find a much better way of testing at scale ... then I think the market’s going to have a much more difficult time,” Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday.The Nasdaq Composite Index has led stocks back from the March market bottom. The tech-heavy index started this week with a six-day winning streak through Monday, its longest of the year. It didn’t last. Although the Nasdaq has remained above its 200-day moving average for weeks, and finished the week strong with gains on Thursday and Friday, for the week it fell into the red, turning in its worst five-day stretch since the coronavirus crash trough on March 23.
Many reasons have been cited for this week’s volatile trading, including a worrisome economic outlook delivered by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, some ugly economic numbers, especially from the retail sector, and renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China. But a look at recent market history suggests that a period of cooling off for the Nasdaq after a big run is not unexpected.
Since 2000, the Nasdaq
’ has experienced five similar hot streaks, at least five consecutive days of gains during a  rolling three-month period when it outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average
by 10% or more. After those Nasdaq rallies, short-term mean reversion tended to occur, with the Nasdaq more likely to sell off and the Dow more likely to gain, according to data from hedge fund trading platform Kensho.
The Kensho data shows that over five similar periods of big gaps between Nasdaq and Dow performance, the first occurring in 2003, in the one-month periods that follow, the Dow has been the better bet. It has averaged a positive return of 2.02% and has traded positively in four of the five months. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has posted an average return of negative 0.43% (-0.43%) and has traded positive in just two of these five month-long periods after its big runs.  
If that pattern holds, it will occur beyond this week’s action. The Nasdaq was not the biggest loser this week. The Dow and S&P 500
were both down even more than the Nasdaq, but all had their biggest weekly losses since the week of March 20, when they dropped more than 12%. 
“Given the amount of uncertainty about this crisis that still looms, we should not be surprised by the setbacks we’ve seen in markets this week,” Scott Knapp, chief market strategist at CUNA Mutual Group, told CNBC.
Tech’s strength is being viewed by some as a permanent change, with the biggest technology firms — Microsoft
, Apple
, Amazon
, Alphabet
and Facebook
 — now representing more than 20% of the S&P 500, and the top five holdings by weight in the Nasdaq. Three of these companies are currently valued at over $1 trillion: Microsoft, Apple and Amazon (Alphabet is not far behind).
“The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the essential role that technology plays for businesses and consumers and stoked expectations that the recession could see many of the largest growth companies become even more dominant,” Salvatore Ruscitti, U.S. equities strategist at MRB Partners, told CNBC earlier this week. The technology-led Nasdaq index has been hot, besting the S&P 500 and Dow in gains during the rebound since the market crash.
Its recent winning streak was stopped this week, and market history suggests that the Dow could be more likely to rally in the near term. "

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comAirline stocks are soaring. Casino, hotel and cruise ship stocks are surging, too. It’s all part of Wall Street’s shifting focus to the reopening of the U.S. economy from its coronavirus-driven downturn. 
But the newfound strength of these sectors, which had been beaten down early in the pandemic, are not why the Nasdaq Composite
hit a new all-time intraday high Monday, explained CNBC’s Jim Cramer.

Tech’s had a brutal year. But four stocks have a bright future, investor says
Zavier Ong
A DAY AGO
To understand the strength of the Nasdaq, the “Mad Money” host said, take note of “the power of FAANG and friends,” using an acronym for Facebook
, Apple
, Amazon
, Netflix
and Google-parent Alphabet
. 
The surge in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Cramer said, is “more representative of this market than the endless rebound in the hospitality and travel stocks in response to the opening of America.” 
Shares of Apple are now up more than 13% for the year, having recovered from a March sell-off that occurred as investor concern over the coronavirus heightened. Cramer noted that some on Wall Street had really soured on the stock, predicting that perhaps its “best years were behind it.” 
But he argued its service revenue has helped fuel its rally. “When people who are stuck at home with nothing to do, they go online, the Amazon, the Apple stores,” said Cramer, who added that the iPhone giant’s Apple Pay stands to benefit in a world where contact-less technology grows in importance.
Additionally, the work-from-home shift due to the pandemic also helps Apple because IT professionals who may have favored other companies have had to accept Apple, Cramer argued. “With a few notable exceptions, they’ve been locked out of the enterprise for years, and that’s now over.” 
Microsoft
 and Amazon are two additional stocks that have powered the Nasdaq’s forceful recovery from coronavirus-induced lows, Cramer said. 
Cramer said Microsoft, shares of which are up nearly 20% this year, has been boosted by management’s strong execution and strength in the company’s cloud business. During the pandemic, cloud use has surged, Cramer said.  
Cramer noted that Amazon, which ended Monday’s session at $2,524, has seen a new price target north of $3,000 from RBC. “I find that plausible, if not totally conservative,” Cramer said, arguing that people who became reliant on the e-commerce giant during the pandemic will continue using it. 
“Once you are hooked on Amazon, it’s very hard to go back to the mall,” he said. 
Cramer said another contributor to the Nasdaq rally is Facebook, which is up nearly 70% from its March trough. That rebound has been helped by some of the social media giant’s savvy moves to help its small- and medium-sized business customers through Facebook Shops, Cramer said. 
Cramer also pointed to the performances of Alphabet, Tesla
and Nvidia
 as key reasons for the Nasdaq’s strength. In addition, Cisco
, with its Webex video conferencing, and PayPal
, with its digital payment services, have both been key contributors to the index’s move higher, Cramer said. 
“It’s the same as the Apple Pay story. PayPal wins in a world where cash and credit cards are too risky to use,” Cramer said. 
The final Nasdaq component Cramer highlighted as being important to its rally: Intel
. Shares of the chip maker have rallied more than 46% from their March 16 low, but Cramer said he had not seen “good numbers” from the company. 
“I think Intel got on this list because its stock was cheap and the company has been selling a lot of chips to a big Chinese company that’s worried about being locked out of the American market,” Cramer said. 
Cramer said the bottom line from these 10 stocks is that “old dogs can pivot to new tricks.” The stocks may not be rocketing higher like some of the once down-and-out stocks being helped by the economic reopening, but those companies have largely been well-timed trades, he said.
By contrast, Cramer said, “these high-quality tech stocks are great long-term investments.” 
Disclosure: Cramer’s charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Nvidia. Stocks that benefit from the reopening of the U.S. economy have recently been surging. 
But CNBC’s Jim Cramer said the all-time intraday high for the Nasdaq ’is “more representative of this market” than the reopening trades.

"Softbank identified as the ‘Nasdaq whale’ that bought billions in stock options, betting on higher prices for the biggest names in tech",EDT-202011:59-AM,"Boockvar said the question now is whether SoftBank unloaded its positions. “We’ll see if they’re reversing it. A lot of the call buying was an upward lift to the market. The sellers of those calls, then had to buy stocks and hedge and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy on the upside,” he said.
The Financial Times said the trading volumes in single stocks had surged beyond the average daily volumes of calls on the broader stock market indices. 
Traders had been monitoring the unusual activity, which may help explain why the stock market had been climbing at the same time the VIX was rising. The VIX
is the CBOE’s Volatility Index, which is calculated based on trading in puts and calls on the S&P 500. The VIX serves as the market’s so-called fear gauge and typically moves higher when stocks are falling, not rising.

Softbank declined comment on a Financial Times story that quoted unnamed sources who said it was buying equity derivatives on a massive scale. Rumors had circulated in the market that there were large players behind the frenzied activity in the options market for big tech and internet stocks, and SoftBank was one named mentioned in connection with extreme volumes in some out-of-the-money calls.

Retail traders dumping stocks en masse including record amounts of Tesla

SoftBank, through its $100 billion Vision Fund, has made big investments on privately held technology start ups. The big investments in the options market is new territory for the investment firm.
Investors have been watching extraordinary activity in out-of-the-money calls which some analysts had seen as a contrarian warning about a pending Nasdaq sell off.  Some of the names with high amounts of activity, include Apple, Tesla, Zoom, and Nvidia.
According to the Wall Street Journal, SoftBank had made regulatory filings showing it bought nearly $4 billion in shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix, plus a stake in Tesla. The paper quoted a source saying that SoftBank spent roughly $4 billion buying call options tied to its stock holdings, but also in other names. It then could profit from the run up in stocks and subsequently unload its position to other parties.
SoftBank was trading in names that are among the key drivers of the stock market. Apple, Amazon , Microsoft, Facebook and Google equal about a quarter of the S&P 500, and they have been drivers of a big chunk of its gains. One options trader explained that those names can be proxies for the market, and can be hedged against the S&P 500 and vice versa.
The options market activity was credited by analysts for adding froth to the stock market itself. Some of that is now reversing. Nasdaq fell sharply Thursday, declining 5%, and was down another 2.5% Friday. The Nasdaq, from its March low to intraday high this week, was up 83%. 
“It’s just a trip to the casino,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “If they’re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you’ve turned into a hedge fund.”SoftBank was the buyer of billions of dollars in technology company options in the past month, according to the Financial Times.
Analysts said the activity in call options, those that bet on stocks rising, added to market froth as sellers of the options bought stocks.
The Wall Street Journal said SoftBank bought $4 billion in options on stocks it owned, like Amazon and Microsoft, but also in other names. "

DisclaimerThe Nasdaq 100

The tech-heavy index has fallen for seven straight days, dropping 5% in the past week as rising rates made high-growth stocks less attractive to investors. Some of the hardest hit include high-flying names including Peloton
, Zoom
, Nvidia
and Tesla
.
“There’s no doubt right now with interest rates going up, talk of inflation, a lot of these high-momentum, high-valuation plays are starting to fade. But look, it’s also a buying opportunity, because, for us, we love growth, but price matters,” Strategic Wealth Partners CEO Mark Tepper told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday.
Tepper owns Peloton and Nvidia shares, and says it may make sense to add to both positions on this pullback.
“I love both companies. I would be putting new money to work right there, right now. We were severely overweight Nvidia, we trimmed it a month or two ago. We’re still overweight, though, because we do believe in them, and that was purely a risk management move for us. … Maybe you get an opportunity if it drops another 10% to get in,” Tepper said.
Peloton has fallen 14% this week; Nvidia was down 7% over that stretch.
Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, prefers a different stock hit hard over the latest sell-off.
“Tesla’s the only one that I’d be looking to add. The support from a technical point of view is down around $600,” Gordon said during the same segment."

Yields added to their advance this week even after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank’s commitment to easy policy and downplayed the risk of inflation, saying it could take three years or more before the Fed’s goals are reached.
Investors shrugged off better-than-expected economic data out Thursday. First-time jobless claims totaled 730,000 for the week ended Feb. 20, versus a print of 845,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Meanwhile, durable goods orders increased by 3.4% in January, compared to a Dow Jones consensus of 1.0% growth. If anything, the strong data exacerbated the move in yields.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 559.85 points, or 1.8%, to 31,402.01, slipping from a record high. The S&P 500 lost 2.5% to 3,829.34 in its worst day since Jan. 27. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 3.5% to 13,119.43, posting its biggest sell-off since Oct. 28. Alphabet, Facebook, and Apple all fell more than 3%, while Tesla dropped 8.1%. Microsoft shed 2%.
The major averages tumbled in a rapid fashion as the 10-year Treasury yield soared as high as 1.6% in a sudden move that some described as a “flash” spike. The yield later settled back down to around 1.52%, its highest level since February 2020.
“It is all about bond yields today,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “There was a flash spike in the 10-year yield and that upset the apple cart, as higher yields are spooking the stock market. Could there be more inflation coming than what most think? Although the Fed isn’t worried about that, the market might be.”
The jump also put the benchmark rate above the S&P 500′s dividend yield, meaning that equities — which are considered riskier assets — have lost their premium over bonds. The milestone could exacerbate the move out of stocks as they become less attractive.
Higher rates tend to hit the technology sector especially hard as the group relies on easy borrowing for superior growth. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 5.4% this week, on pace for its second weekly loss in a row. Consumer discretionary and info tech are the two biggest losers among 11 S&P 500 sectors, falling 5.4% and 4.5%, respectively.
It’s “just a full on rout in the bond market. So that filters into everything else,” said Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere. “It looks like we just had a flash move in bonds. With a puke move that drove [10-year] yields to 1.6%... We just have to wait for some form of equilibrium in bonds.”"
"Nasdaq 100 could be headed for a ‘pause,’ so here are the companies that could benefit",EDT-20208:12-AM,"“We still like the Nasdaq, but feel the larger more influential names are in need of a pause,” MKM Partners chief market technician JC O’Hara said in a note to clients. 
MKM said it has concerns about the correlation between the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq 100 Volatility index. Historically, when these two indicators fire in unison a pullback is near, the firm said. MKM told clients it’s time to take profits in the index’s winners like Tesla, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft. Instead, it said to find the less popular names to bet on. 
“As breadth expands, we can rotate out of the largest Nasdaq 100 names and look for opportunity in the lower half of the index,” O’Hara added. 
Here is a look at the list of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 that MKM Partners said are a good idea to rotate into. (This story is for CNBC Pro subscribers only.)

Invesco is launching a new Nasdaq ETF to capitalize on the tech craze,EDT-202010:26-AM,"In the ETF space, success begets success.
Just look at what Invesco is doing Tuesday. It’s launching a new product, the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF (QQQJ).

Tech’s had a brutal year. But four stocks have a bright future, investor says
Zavier Ong
A DAY AGO
It might more appropriately be called the Nasdaq 100 Junior Varsity list.
The Invesco QQQ Trust
(QQQ) started tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index in 1999. Since then, it’s become the fifth-largest ETF listed in the U.S., with $135 billion in assets under management.
Now, Invesco is looking to capitalize on the interest in technology and growth stocks by offering a new “junior” QQQ.
Any why not? QQQ is up nearly 40% this year. Shares outstanding are up nearly 20% since March, a sign of the exploding interest in the growth stocks the fund is famous for.
The Invesco Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ETF will consist of 100 mid-cap companies that are using technology in interesting or innovative ways. Included are obvious tech choices like Seagate
and internet security firm Zscaler
, but also companies like Garmin
, Lyft
, and social game developer Zynga
, not necessarily tech companies.
Why, in an ETF known for tech heavyweights, would it want to include nontech companies?
“QQQJ will give investors access to 100 mid-cap companies using technology to disrupt their sector,” said John Hoffman, Invesco’s head of Americas ETFs. “While this does include companies in the technology sector, the commonality across these companies is their legacy of using innovation and technology to create competitive advantages across multiple sectors and industries.”
Besides, the Nasdaq 100 has never been exclusively about tech. It has always had a healthy weighting of consumer stocks (Pepsi
), consumer cyclicals (Costco
, Starbucks
), and even health care (Amgen
).
This junior QQQ is part of a series of new products Invesco is launching around the QQQ on Tuesday, which Invesco is calling an “Innovation Suite.” Also launching is the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQM), a lower-cost version of the QQQ for longer-term buy and hold investors, Invesco Nasdaq 100 Index Fund (IVNQX), a mutual fund tied to the QQQ for investors (like some retirement plan advisors) who can’t invest in ETFs but can invest in mutual funds, and the Invesco Nasdaq 100 Growth Leaders Portfolio (QQQG), a unit investment trust.
This isn’t the first time we have seen a “junior varsity” version of an ETF. In 2009, Van Eck, on the heels of its very successful Gold Miners ETF (GDX), launched its Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), which has become a regular part of the gold trading space."
"Tesla stock went into reverse and took the Nasdaq with it, possibly signaling near-term top",EDT-20207:15-PM,"The Dow
ended the day higher, up 10 points at 26,085, while the S&P 500
was down 0.9% at 3,155. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund
ETF was up 0.4% Monday. The S&P industrial sector ended the day in the green, up 0.4%.
“I think there’s a lot of support for the QQQs even if it pulls back to its 50-day moving average. That’s a big hit but there’s a lot of support there.”  The QQQs  ETF represents the Nasdaq 100, and its 50-day moving average is 237.32, about 20 points from Monday’s close of 258.54.
Sluymer said Tesla’s volume of over 37 million was the largest since February.
“Tesla is a pretty good lightning rod for high momentum, high growth stocks,” said Sluymer. He said index options expire Wednesday and equities options expire Friday, potentially driving some of the volatility.“Tesla is the poster boy of a parabolic move here, and Tesla started to roll over at about 11:40 a.m.,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “That sell-off accelerated and at about 2 p.m., the California headlines exaggerated the move ... We know it’s a one-way street. It got really just stretched and overbought and overcrazed in these tech stocks.” 
Stocks like Amazon,
Adobe,
NVIDIA
and Facebook
all hit new highs before doing an about face, and ending sharply lower. They were among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq, which closed down 2.1% at 10,390.84, more than 430 below its intraday high. Apple
also hit a new high, but it only closed down a half percent.
“There is a case to be made that this is what reversal days are made of,” said Boockvar. He said Monday was considered an outside day reversal, a leading indicator for a potential trend change.
The stocks were already tumbling when California announced it would shut down some businesses, like indoor restaurants, movie theaters and bars because of the renewed spread of the coronavirus.
Rob Sluymer, technical analyst at Fundstrat, said Monday’s Nasdaq trading may signal a short-term rotation from growth to cyclicals. Technically, the move was a negative reversal because the Nasdaq hit all-time highs before reversing hard, ending below Friday’s close.
“We had a big move in growth. It’s ripe for profit-taking. ... I think we’re now going to see a tactical move in another direction,” he said, adding the tech bull run is not over.
“At the very opposite end, you had banks and cyclicals trying to bottom here. I think you’re setting up for at least a short-term reversal in the market from growth back to value,” he said. “I think it’s a short-term peak likely developing.”The Nasdaq’s stunning reversal, led by Tesla, could signal that big tech has run out of steam and hit a near term top for now,  strategists said.
Some of the hottest Nasdaq names and both the Nasdaq Composite
and the Nasdaq 100
hit new highs Monday, before a massive turnaround, which started just before midday as high-flying Tesla
suddenly went into reverse.

Oatly shares soar 18% in company’s public market debut on Nasdaq,EDT-20214:23-PM,"Oatly shares ended the day up more than 18% after the company’s public market debut Thursday.
The stock’s opening trade was $22.12 just before noon, giving it a market value of $13.1 billion and putting shares about 30% above the initial public offering price. Shares lost some of those gains in the minutes following the first trade.
On Wednesday night, the Swedish company priced its U.S. initial public offering at $17 per share, at the top of its indicated range, raising $1.4 billion. At that price, the implied valuation is $10 billion, well above the current market value of another company that specializes in making substitutes for animal products, Beyond Meat
. The oat-milk maker is trading on the Nasdaq under the stock ticker “OTLY.”
Oatly made its U.S. debut in coffee shops five years ago, building a strong following for its oat-based milk substitute. The company focused on getting baristas and coffee drinkers hooked on oat milk’s creamy texture and ability to froth before pushing into grocery stores. Since then, oat milk sales have surged, more than tripling in 2020, based on Nielsen data. Still, almond milk holds on to the top spot for dairy substitutes.
Oatly has also been expanding its portfolio, branching out into oat-based ice cream and yogurt.
In 2020, Oatly’s revenue more than doubled, reaching $421.4 million. Food service accounted for a quarter of sales, and retailers accounted for the rest. The company reported a net loss of $60.36 million as it focused on entering new markets, building brand awareness and expanding production.
“I don’t see anyone else taking that leadership position the way we are,” CEO Toni Petersson said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday. “We are really serious and ambitious about what we’re going to do here.”
Oprah, Natalie Portman and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz are among the big names who have invested in Oatly. State-backed China Resources took a majority stake in the company in 2016 through a joint venture with Belgium’s Verlinvest, and Blackstone invested $200 million in the company last year, giving the firm a stake of about 10%.
Oatly said in regulatory filings that it plans to use the IPO proceeds for working capital, to fund incremental growth and other general corporate purposes.Oatly priced its initial public offering at $17 per share, giving it an implied valuation of $10 billion.

Google’s provider of at-home Covid-19 tests is now a $3 billion company traded on Nasdaq,EDT-20216:09-PM,"Cue’s public debut comes as Elizabeth Holmes, founder of defunct blood-testing company Theranos, is on criminal trial for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She has pleaded not guilty.
Khattak said Theranos naturally comes up in conversation, given the timing of the two events.
“As a company growing and having that sort of in your backyard, basically, it’s something that essentially creates a much higher hurdle,” Khattak said. “But, we are in the fortunate position that we have a product that’s widely used, There’s no black box that you can’t understand what’s going on.”
Cue Health also has independent clinical studies from the Mayo Clinic and has been thoroughly vetted through health validations.
“We’re excited to be through a lot of those hurdles,” Khattak said.
WATCH: Cue Health CEO on FDA emergency authorization for Covid at-home testsKhattak said the Google partnership began because his company was using the Google Cloud Platform, which competes with Amazon
Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Google approached Cue Health when it realized that its workforce needed the kind of testing product Khattak’s team was developing.
“It kind of converged at that point,” Khattak said. “We were doing everything we could to scale up and meet demands of our customers so we were not necessarily in outreach mode. But given the connection we had, we chose them and they chose us.”
Their work together goes deeper.
In August of this year, Cue and Google Cloud entered into a partnership to develop real-time variant tracking and sequencing of Covid-19, the prospectus says.
They aim to create an “advanced respiratory biothreat detection system spanning from the Company’s at-home diagnostic testing to full real-time viral sequencing as well as analytical and predictive capability using Google Cloud powered solutions,” according to the filing.As of August, Cue had sold 5 million testing kits and said that it’s manufacturing cartridges at a rate that exceeds 15 million a year.
“We anticipate growing our manufacturing capacity to a rate equivalent to tens of millions of Cue Cartridges per year by the end of 2021,” the filing said.
Cue Health has had to hire to meet scaling demands. The company had fewer than 100 employees in 2020 and now has more than 1,250. In April, Glenn Wada, a senior vice president at Salesforce
, was named chief commercial officer. Khattak said that despite the competitiveness for tech talent, Cue Health has been able to recruit because it’s addressing such a tangible global problem. 
Beyond Covid-19, Cue Health says it’s working on a number of tests that can be completed using saliva, urine and blood samples and nasal swabs. Those diagnostic tests will cover things like respiratory health, sexual health and determining risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease.
Khattak said the company hopes to provide direct-to-consumer virtual care and testing for common illnesses like strep throat.
For Google, the agreement with Cue Health has allowed employees to order additional test strips through the company’s internal resources portal. Without the availability of in-office perks like free food or other amenities, the company has tried other ways to appeal to employees, offering resources for mental and physical health.
Google had planned for employees to return to the office in September, but that date got pushed to Jan. 10, 2022.The company is still operating under emergency use authorization as the products have not been fully FDA cleared or approved.
“We’ve been really working hard through the pandemic,” Cue Health CEO Ayub Khattak said in an interview with CNBC on Friday after the IPO. The team “showed great determination to scale in the midst of the pandemic, which was quite a challenge.”
Khattak founded the company with product chief Clint Sever originally under the name Ruubix. Before last year, they were mostly focused on research and development.
The latest boon to the business came from Google, a deal that wasn’t announced publicly and was first disclosed in one sentence in Cue Health’s IPO prospectus earlier this month.
“In April 2021, the Company and Google LLC entered into an agreement to provide Cue Health Readers and Cue COVID-19 Test Kits to Google’s U.S.-based employees through year end,” the filing said.
Cue said that revenue in the first half of the year reached $201.9 million, up from $5 million in the same period a year earlier. More than 80% of its revenue came from sales to the public sector. Of the remaining $34.8 million in revenue, $28.9 million was from a “single enterprise customer,” Cue Health said.
Khattak declined to name that customer, but people familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it’s Google. The people asked not to be identified because the information is confidential.
A Google spokesperson declined to comment.
Cue Health could still be a particularly risky bet for investors because the company hasn’t proven it has a market outside of Covid-19 tests.
The company acknowledges that issue at the beginning of the risk factors section in its prospectus. “Our COVID-19 test is currently our only commercially available test,” the filing says. “Our limited commercial operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.” In April, Google
started sending at-home Covid-19 tests to its U.S. employees from a little-known start-up in San Diego called Cue Health.
Most of Cue Health’s business up to that point had come from a deal with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide rapid tests to the federal government. Google instantly became the health tech company’s biggest private sector customer.

Cue Health has used that relationship to help build a story compelling enough for public market investors. On Friday, the company debuted on the Nasdaq under ticker symbol “HLTH,” and the stock climbed 25% to $20 at the close. That values Cue Health at $2.9 billion.
Founded in 2010, Cue Health had only a tiny amount of revenue before the Covid-19 pandemic. It spent the better part of a decade as a diagnostic testing company in research mode.
Everything changed in 2020, when the worst pandemic in a century suddenly made access to instant testing essential. In June 2020, the company received its first emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 tests.
Cue Health’s test kit includes a wand, cartridge and reader. Users take a nasal swab with the wand and insert it in the small box, where a reader feeds results to a smartphone app within about 20 minutes. There’s no need for processing at a lab.
In July 2020, a month after the emergency authorization, the National Basketball Association began using Cue Health tests for its “NBA bubble” in Orlando, Florida, where games were restarting without fans. Three months after that, the company signed a $480.9 million deal with the DOD, to “meet the unprecedented demand for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing,” according to the prospectus.Cue Health debuted on the Nasdaq on Friday under ticker symbol “HLTH”

Top investor Stanley Druckenmiller shared concerns on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday morning that unnerved investors to start the day.
While Druckenmiller said he was still long stocks somewhat, the hedge fund manager said assets were in a “raging mania” and that the Fed and U.S. government risked endangering the U.S. dollar’s reserve status by injecting too much costly stimulus into an already hot economy.
“I can’t find any period in history where monetary and fiscal policy were this out of step with the economic circumstances, not one,” Druckenmiller said. “If they want to do all this and risk our reserve currency status, risk an asset bubble blowing up, so be it. But I think we ought to at least have a conversation about it.”
The latest headlines, including a labor shortage as well as a jump in Consumer Price Index in March, helped fuel inflation worries.
Job openings soared to a record high in March as employers struggled to find workers to fill those positions, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
Even as help wanted jumped from February by 597,000, or 8%, to 8.12 million, hires rose just 215,000, or 3.7%, to just over 6 million.
“When valuations remain high, even factoring in yesterday’s and today’s selling, the promise of rock bottom interest rates fades as the market questions the strong job openings report against the availability of labor and the need to boost wages to fill the positions, not to mention concerns that fiscal largesse is keeping workers from moving back into the labor force,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial.

U.S. futures sank after the comments. The trade advisor then walked back his comment, saying his words were taken “wildly out of context” and reassured that the deal is, in fact, not over. President Donald Trump also weighed in following Navarro’s Monday interview, writing on Twitter that “The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!” Futures then recovered.

Investors rotated out of growth names, resuming a trend seen earlier this year amid rising fears of inflation and higher interest rates. Facebook dropped more than 4%, while Amazon and Netflix both dropped over 3%. Alphabet dipped more than 2% after a downgrade by Citigroup. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF fell 5% to its lowest level since November.
“The tech price action is especially frustrating for many as the thought was Friday would elicit a more sustainable rebound in the space,” Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. “Instead, the group is seeing aggressive selling and accumulating technical damage as prices breach key levels.”
Technology stocks rallied on Friday after a far-weaker-than-expected April jobs report eased concerns about a policy change from the Federal Reserve. Tech stocks have been winning under the low-rates regime during the pandemic.
Utilities and consumer staples were the two biggest gainers on Monday. Earlier in the session, investors had bid up shares that stand to benefit the most from the economic recovery, including energy, financials and industrials, but the sharp sell-off in tech weighed on sentiment and caused these shares to roll over.
Wall Street came off a mixed week with the Dow and the S&P 500 advancing 2.7% and 1.2%, respectively. Despite a 0.9% rally on the week’s final session, the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.5% over the same period.
The stock market confirmed the so-called “Dow Theory” bullish breakout last week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average reached new highs simultaneously.
Transportation stocks are widely viewed as a barometer of global economic activity. The rebound in these shares signals an accelerating recovery from the pandemic.
Still, April’s jobs report showed that U.S. employers added 266,000 net payrolls last month. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected 1 million additions.

Wall Street was coming off a session in which the major averages closed sharply lower after a steep downturn in tech names. Those losses came after the benchmarks gave up solid gains.

“Decent early gains quickly faded, and as many stated last week’s lows were critical to hold,” Busch said in a note to clients. “Perhaps, for the first time in a while, we can say advantage bears.”"

"Nasdaq to tighten listing rules, restricting Chinese IPOs, sources say",EDT-202010:18-PM,"The proposed rules will also require auditing firms to ensure that their international franchises comply with global standards, the sources said. Nasdaq will also inspect the auditing of small U.S. firms that audit the accounts of Chinese IPO hopefuls, the sources added.
U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox Business in an interview last week that he was looking “very strongly” at requiring Chinese companies that list in New York to follow U.S. accounting standards. But he noted that “the problem with that” was that Chinese companies could decide to list in London or Hong Kong instead.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The regulator’s accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), is still unable to access those critical records, it has said.
The PCAOB, which was set up by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act and is overseen by the SEC, is tasked with policing the accounting firms that sign off on the books of the nation’s listed companies. Its problems with Chinese audit quality have been festering since 2011, when scores of Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges were accused of accounting irregularities.
The SEC is planning to host a roundtable this summer for companies, auditors, advisers and other parties to discuss issues with IPOs of foreign companies and their accounting disclosures, one of the sources said.Nasdaq also unveiled some restrictions on listings last year, seeking to curb IPOs by small Chinese companies. Their shares often trade thinly because most stay in the hands of a few insiders. Their low liquidity makes them unattractive to many large institutional investors, to whom Nasdaq is seeking to cater to.
The new tightening of the listing standards reflects the bourse operator’s concerns about some Chinese companies seeking U.S. IPOs. Last month, Luckin Coffee
, which had a U.S. IPO in early 2019, announced that an internal investigation had shown its chief operating officer and other employees fabricated sales deals.
The new rules will require companies from some countries, including China, to raise $25 million in their IPO or, alternatively, at least a quarter of their post-listing market capitalization, the sources said.
This is the first time Nasdaq has put a minimum value on the size of IPOs. The change would have prevented several Chinese companies currently listed on the Nasdaq from going public. Out of 155 Chinese companies that listed on Nasdaq since 2000, 40 grossed IPO proceeds below $25 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Small Chinese firms pursue these IPOs because they allow their founders and backers to cash out, rewarding them with U.S. dollars they cannot easily access because of China’s capital controls. The companies also use their Nasdaq-listed status to convince lenders in China to fund them and often get subsidies from Chinese local authorities for becoming publicly traded.Nasdaq Inc
is set to unveil new restrictions on initial public offerings (IPOs), a move that will make it harder for some Chinese companies to debut on its stock exchange, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

“We believe COIN, the most popular consumer-facing cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., is positioned to be a primary beneficiary of the increased adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets as it continues to scale in the U.S. and internationally,” the brokerage firm wrote in a note to clients.
Coinbase held 11.3% of the world’s crypto assets as of March 31, and BTIG’s analysts said this market share was “core” to their bull case for the company. If the market value of all cryptocurrencies — which currently stands at $2.2 trillion — were to continue growing, “then the company’s upside could be immense,” they said.“The risk management from a regulatory and the operational perspective is much better on Coinbase” compared to its competitors, Carol Alexander, a professor at University of Sussex Business School, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday.
“They’ve got this solid revenue stream from the fees and the custodial services as well. There’s no real competitor to them on the centralized exchanges because Kraken, Gemini — I don’t think they’re the next ones to go.”
Coinbase made estimated revenues of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, a ninefold increase from the same period a year earlier, while profits surged from $32 million to between $730 million and $800 million. The number of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users rose to 6.1 million from 2.8 million three months earlier.Coinbase
shares whipsawed Thursday, a day after the cryptocurrency exchange went public in a blockbuster direct listing.
The firm’s stock closed down 1.68%, though had climbed as high as 6.4% in the morning.
The company said that it temporarily disabled withdrawals of ether tokens due to an issue with a recent upgrade to that currency’s network. The so-called “Berlin hard fork” is part of a broader effort to make the Ethereum blockchain faster and more secure.
Coinbase was briefly valued at as much as $100 billion in its Nasdaq debut Wednesday, a landmark event for the cryptocurrency industry. The stock closed at $328.28 per share, valuing Coinbase at $85.8 billion on a fully diluted basis.
Investors were reacting to news that Ark Invest founder and CEO Cathie Wood loaded up on about $245.9 million worth of Coinbase shares on the firm’s first day of trading. Wood is a longtime bitcoin bull, believing bitcoin and other digital tokens could eventually become part of the recommended portfolio for everyday investors.
Coinbase’s debut was hailed as a “watershed” moment for crypto, after years of skepticism from Wall Street giants and global regulators. But there are concerns that volatility in digital assets and regulatory uncertainty may weigh on the company’s share price long-term — as well as fierce competition from other players such as Binance, Kraken and Gemini.Coinbase shares whipsawed Thursday, a day after the cryptocurrency exchange went public in a blockbuster direct listing.

EV start-up Canoo unveils new vehicle ahead of Nasdaq debut,EST-20207:24-PM,"Shares of Hennessy were down 10% during midday trading Thursday to about $18. The stock is still up by about 69% since the deal with Canoo was announced on Aug. 18.
This is Canoo’s second planned vehicle. The first was a smaller, pill-shaped vehicle designed more for consumers. It’s expected to be available through a membership-only vehicle service by the company beginning in 2022, according to Canoo.
During Thursday’s vehicle unveiling, the company also teased what appeared to be a car and a pickup truck under two sheets.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Canoo’s anticipated ticker symbol is “GOEV.” The company had previously announced a ticker symbol of “CNOO.”Canoo said the MPDV will be available in two sizes with varying EV ranges and battery sizes. The company says the range of the smaller van, known as MPDV1, is expected between 130 miles and 230 miles, while that of the larger van, MPDV2, is between 90 miles and 190 miles based on battery sizes. Canoo is taking reservations and $100 refundable deposits for the vehicles on its website.
Canoo is part of a wave of new speculative EV start-ups that plan to enter the market after going public through reverse mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, also known as blank-check companies. The company announced its merger deal with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.
in August.
Canoo is expected to be listed on the Nasdaq as “GOEV” on Tuesday following a shareholder meeting to approve the merger on Monday. The deal is expected to provide Canoo with approximately $600 million to support the production and launch of EVs.Electric vehicle start-up Canoo unveiled a new delivery van Thursday ahead of its public debut on the Nasdaq next week.
The futuristic-looking van — known as a multi-purpose delivery vehicle, or MPDV, because of the ways it can be upfitted — is designed for everything from last-mile deliveries to food trucks, according to the California company. It is expected to start at around $33,000.
“There are many use cases that this vehicle can do,” Canoo Chairman Tony Aquila, a major investor in the company, said during a video unveiling of the MPDV. “We wanted it to look very smart, very modern but at the same time be very affordable.”
Production of the vehicle is targeted to begin in 2022 and ramp up in 2023. The company did not announce specific plans for production, but it has previously announced a strategic relationship with auto supplier and contract manufacturer Magna International
.
Such commercial vehicles are anticipated to be a key driver for the sale of profitable EVs for the automotive industry. It’s a segment start-ups and legacy automakers want to enter rapidly in the coming years. Ford Motor

Satellite company AST SpaceMobile expects to close SPAC deal next week and begin trading on Nasdaq,EDT-20214:03-PM,"Satellite-to-smartphone broadband company AST & Science expects to close its SPAC merger next week, the company said on Thursday. Its stock will trade on the Nasdaq.
Last year, the company announced plans to merge with special purpose acquisition company New Providence
, which trades under ticker NPA
.
Stockholders voted on Thursday to approve the transaction, with the closing expected “on or about April 6,” or next Tuesday. The combined company of AST & Science and New Providence will be known as AST Space Mobile, and will trade under the ticker ASTS.
New Providence’s stock slipped 2.4% in trading on Thursday to close at $11.39 a share.
AST SpaceMobile, based in Midland, Texas, is building a network of satellites, also known as a constellation, that is designed to deliver broadband from space directly to consumer smartphones. Existing satellite networks require additional physical devices to connect to the service, such as Iridium’s
 mobile satellite phones or SpaceX’s Starlink user terminals.
The company, which raised about $120 million before the SPAC deal, expects to add about $462 million in total proceeds from the merger. The new capital will fund the company’s development of its network, with AST planning to launch its next demonstration satellite BlueWalker 3 later this year.

will enter the Nasdaq, replacing BioMarin Pharmaceutical

The six new names have been “rising in the ranks” of the stay-at-home onslaught, Nasdaq’s Sean Wasserman told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.
“We have six really great, exciting new companies coming into the index, companies like Peloton, Atlassian, Okta that really benefited from the current remote work-from-home environment,” said Wasserman, Nasdaq’s global head of index and advisor solutions.
The move will impact the roughly $150 billion currently tied to the Nasdaq 100 in the form of trading products such as the Invesco QQQ Trust
(QQQ), a popular ETF that tracks the index.
The Nasdaq’s rebalancing process employs “a very straightforward, rules-based approach” that accounts for how easily those products can replicate it and how investable those products would then be, he said.
And while the QQQ is frequently cast as a tech index — its largest holdings are Apple
, Microsoft
, Amazon
, Alphabet
and Facebook
— its less prominent holdings serve to “round out” its exposure, Wasserman said.
Although it retains a roughly 48% weighting in tech, “it is quite diversified across sectors such as health care, consumer services, consumer goods with all the companies ... mentioned including other ones like Moderna
that really help to round out the index and the overall exposure that it provides,” he said.
The QQQ closed less than 1% higher on Monday at $304.04.

On Monday, a Democratic aide told CNBC that Congress is looking to extend government funding for an additional week to buy more time to scrape together a new relief measure. The news came after a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a $908 billion aid proposal last week.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell initially shut down the measure, but a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi later said she and McConnell discussed their “shared commitment to completing an omnibus [spending bill] and Covid relief as soon as possible.”
“At this point, the market is anticipating at least several hundred billion dollars of incremental stimulus in 2020,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, in a note. But “whereas Washington had been a tailwind in late-Nov and early-Dec as fiscal progress occurred faster than anticipated, the whole topic is starting to become more neutral (and possibly a headwind to the extent Congress fails to deliver on investor assumptions).”
Lawmakers have been at a stalemate over additional fiscal aid for months, raising concern about the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The increasing number of coronavirus cases has led some states and cities to re-impose stricter social distancing measures to curb the outbreak.
“Renewed lockdown restrictions in response to the third wave of the pandemic are likely to weigh on the economy in coming months, but we don’t expect a double-dip,” said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. “The economy could be booming next spring if enough of us are inoculated against the virus.”

"Stocks rise as tech rallies amid falling yields, Nasdaq closes more than 1% higher",EDT-20214:06-PM,"U.S. stocks jumped on Monday led by technology shares as investors flocked back into growth names amid declining bond yields.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2% to 13,377.54 as the 10-year Treasury yield retreated. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 3,940.59, breaking a two-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 103.23 points, or 0.3%, to 32,731.20.
Shares of Tesla added 2.3% as rates fell and as Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest put out a new price target on the stock which calls for it to quadruple in four years. Apple, Microsoft and Netflix all gained at least 2%, while Amazon and Facebook climbed more than 1% each.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell 5 basis points to around 1.68%, after touching a 14-month high last week (1 basis point equals 0.01%). The move higher in rates in recent weeks has raised concerns about valuations on growth and tech stocks.
 “After the reopening exuberance fades and interest rates level off, investors will rotate back into large cap technology stocks with strong free cash flow, recurring revenues and increasing user penetration,” said Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners.
Industrials got a boost after the New York Times reported that President Joe Biden is eyeing an infrastructure deal with as much as $3 trillion spending to boost the economy. Most Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs were expecting around $2 trillion on infrastructure spending. Shares of Caterpillar traded into the green following the news and closed the session 0.3% higher.
The major averages rebounded from a losing week when a jump in bond yields pressured the high-growth stocks, which had led the indexes back from their pandemic-sparked sell-off last year. The Dow and S&P 500 fell 0.5% and 0.8% last week, respectively, breaking two-week winning streaks. The Nasdaq lost 0.8% during the same period.
Still, optimism about the markets and the economic recovery has been growing as vaccines roll out across the country, with the pace of Americans getting shots climbing in recent weeks.
U.S. trial data released Monday showed the Covid vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness and 100% effective against severe disease and hospitalization.
Many on Wall Street believe bond yields’ rebound to pre-pandemic levels shouldn’t be too alarming given the magnitude of the economic recovery from pandemic-triggered recession.
“We believe the recent rise in nominal government bond yields, led by real yields, is justified and reflects markets awakening to positive developments on the faster-than-expected activity restart combined with historically large fiscal stimulus – all helped by a ramp-up in vaccinations in the U.S.,” Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, said in a note."

The government said Friday morning that the economy added 1.37 million nonfarm jobs in August, slightly better than estimates, after a revised 1.7 million additions in July. While the pace of rehiring during the coronavirus slowed month-over-month, the nation’s August unemployment rate dropped to 8.4%, lower than economists had expected. The jobless rate was by far the lowest since the coronavirus shutdown in March. August’s job gains mean that more than half of those displaced during the pandemic are back at work."
"The U.S. government needs to get involved in the A.I. race against China, Nasdaq executive says",EST-20201:32-AM,"Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve this month said it would keep rates near zero for as long as necessary to help the economy recover from the effects of Covid-19.
“With more predictable markets and low interest rates, I think you’ll continue to have a healthy demand and pipeline for IPOs,” Knight said.
He also said the president-elect’s priority is managing the coronavirus crisis and “hopefully getting to the place where we have a widely available vaccine,” which would act as a foundation for a recovery.
“We cannot have a strong economy with unhealthy American people,” he said. “Once we can restore their health and deal with the pandemic, I think you’ll start to see the economy fully recover.”
— CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal, Sam Shead and Catherine Clifford contributed to this report.Separately, Knight weighed in on what a Biden presidency would mean for the initial public offering market.
He said the pipeline traditionally slows down when a new president comes into office because there’s uncertainty about possible policy changes.
However, he sees low interest rates and the likelihood of a divided government as positive for the IPO market. “We expect there will not be radical, if you will, changes in public policy,” Knight said. “Change will come incrementally, and I think that makes markets more predictable.”Predicting that society will benefit from any innovation that comes from artificial intelligence, Knight added: “If the U.S. is going to continue to be a growing economy and innovative economy, it has to master that new technology.”
Artificial intelligence refers to technology in which computers or machines imitate human intelligence such as in image and pattern recognition. It is increasingly being used in sectors from financial services to health care, but has been criticized as being “more dangerous than nukes” by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Musk fears that AI will develop too quickly for humans to safely manage, but researchers have pushed back, calling him a “sensationalist.”The U.S. needs to take a “strategic approach” as it competes with China on artificial intelligence, according to a Nasdaq executive.
AI is an area that is going to only develop in partnership with government, and U.S. authorities need to get involved, said Edward Knight, vice chairman of Nasdaq.
The Chinese government has already started “investing heavily” and working with their private sector to develop new technologies based on artificial intelligence, he said.
Beijing in 2017 said it wanted to become the world leader in AI by 2030 and aims to make the industry worth 1 trillion yuan ($152 billion). It included a roadmap about how AI could be developed and deployed.
“I think the U.S. already is leading, but it needs more … of a strategic approach involving the government,” Knight told CNBC’s Dan Murphy as part of FinTech Abu Dhabi, which was held online this year. “The private sector alone cannot take on the entire Chinese government and private sector, which is very focused on this.”The U.S. private sector alone cannot compete with the entire Chinese government and private sector in tech development, said Edward Knight of Nasdaq.
China’s government has already started “investing heavily” in developing new technologies based on artificial intelligence, he said.

But aside from Wall Street’s fears of stricter quarantines and business closures, DeBusschere said the resurgence also weighs against President Donald Trump’s reelection odds, which could give challenger Joe Biden the chance to curb the 2017 tax cuts.
The “market is going down on this...bottom line,” DeBusschere wrote. It “brings up the question: What will California do? They have had consistent case growth and never really opened up.” Markets may also dislike the fact that an acceleration of the disease would reinforce calls for even more fiscal stimulus from Congress if investors believe the spending wouldn’t help slow the virus, the strategist wrote. — FranckStocks were on pace for their worst day since June 11 under heavy trading on Wednesday.

Even with the recent rise in cases for some states, Bullard said data show that the daily infections and in particular hospitalization and death rates have fallen substantially from the worst phase of the coronavirus pandemic in mid-April. With that, second-quarter growth is likely to be the worst in post-World War II history, but he thinks the U.S. is “going to be able to manage pretty well. My base case is we’ll have a pretty robust recovery in the second half of the year.” He added that people shouldn’t expect a Covid-19 vaccine soon and instead should focus on prevention and management measures. One area he cautioned against is taking the same approach going forward as the country did during the shutdown. “Depression would develop if we had many, many businesses closing up shop all at once, and that would take a long time to recovery from. So we definitely want to stay out of that situation,” Bullard said. “An important part of the depression risk that we face is [if] we get into that situation, we’ll have worse health outcomes and a worse economy. So it’s the worst of all worlds to be in that situation. We don’t want to be there.” – CoxS&P 500 closed down 2.59% for its first negative day in three and its worst day since June 11 when the S&P lost 5.89%

"S&P 500 jumps 1% to a record as Biden signs new stimulus, Nasdaq rallies 2.5%",EST-20214:11-PM,"U.S. stocks climbed to record highs Thursday as the comeback in tech shares resumed, while the signing of additional fiscal stimulus gave sentiment a further boost.
The S&P 500 jumped 1% to 3,939.34, hitting a new closing high and retaking its previous record from Feb. 16. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.5% to 13,398.67 amid a rotation back into tech. Tesla popped 4.7%, while Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix all advanced at least 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 188.57 points, or 0.6%, to 32485.59. Earlier in the session, the blue-chip benchmark gained more than 300 points to hit an intraday record high.
President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package into law Thursday afternoon. The plan will send direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, and will also put nearly $20 billion into Covid-19 vaccinations and $350 billion into state, local and tribal relief. The White House said Thursday that stimulus checks could start hitting bank accounts this weekend.
“The stimulus is beating the virus at least as far as the market is concerned,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. “And real rates being near negative is just historically a very strong tailwind for asset prices. That can get ignored on a day-to-day basis especially when people become concerned that inflation is going to rear its head, but at the end of the day, inflation is just coming back to normal.”
Tech and growth stocks are rebounding from a swift correction triggered by rising interest rates. Higher rates make profits in far-off years seem less attractive to investors and can knock down stocks with relatively high valuations.
Chip stocks jumped sharply Thursday after China’s semiconductor trade association formed a new group to work with their U.S. counterparts to ease recent trade tensions between the two countries. Nvidia and AMD jumped more than 4% each, while Xilinx popped 6.2%.
The Nasdaq Composite dipped into correction territory on Monday, falling more than 10% from its recent high. Now the tech-heavy benchmark is about 5.5% off that high.
The 10-year Treasury yield, which had retreated from its recent high of 1.6%, was little changed at 1.52% on Thursday.
On the data front, investors cheered a slightly better-than-expected reading on weekly jobless claims. The Labor Department reported that first-time filings for unemployment insurance in the week ended March 6 totaled a seasonally adjusted 712,000, below the Dow Jones estimate of 725,000.
“The drop in jobless claims is another win for the week, and a solid sign that we’re making some strides toward pre-pandemic life,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E-Trade Financial. “There’s a pretty optimistic picture being painted despite some of the inflation-related market jitters we’ve seen over the past few weeks.”
The economic reopening, coupled with additional fiscal stimulus, accelerated the rotation into more cyclical sectors, such as energy. The S&P 500 energy sector has been the biggest winner this year, up nearly 40% so far."

Lerner noted, however, that this “tends to be a period where historically you would start to consolidate some of the gains.”
Shares of Salesforce
 surged 26% — their biggest one-day gain ever — after the software company posted blowout earnings after the bell on Tuesday.  Salesforce will be added to the Dow at the end of August, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Monday. The changes are driven by Apple’s coming stock split, which will reduce the technology weighting in the price-weighted average.
Facebook and Netflix jumped 8.2% and 11.6%, respectively. Amazon advanced nearly 3% while Alphabet and Microsoft gained 2.4% and 2.2%, respectively. Apple rose 1.4%. 
Wednesday’s gains put the S&P 500 up more than 58% since hitting an intraday low on March 23. The Nasdaq has soared by 75% in that time period. 
But “if you cut through it all, this rally has really been about five or six stocks,” said Mark Travis, CEO of Intrepid Capital, referring to the major tech names. “I think it creates a bit of a smokescreen as far as what’s really happening below the surface.”"
"Dow rises 300 points to touch a record, Nasdaq sheds 2% as rotation out of tech continues",EST-20214:25-PM,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed on Monday as investors piled into economic comeback plays after Senate approval of a new Covid stimulus package, while a continuous sell-off in high-flying tech shares put pressure on the broader market.
The blue-chip benchmark gained 306.14 points, or 1%, to 31,802.44 led by Disney. At its session high, the 30-stock average jumped 650 points to hit an intraday record high. The S&P 500 erased a 1% gain to close 0.5% lower at 3,821.35. The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.4% in volatile trading to 12,609.16 as Apple dropped 4.2% and Tesla fell 5.8%. Alphabet and Netflix both slipped more than 4%.
The tech-heavy benchmark closed more than 10% below its Feb.12 closing high, falling into correction territory.
The Senate passed a $1.9 trillion economic relief and stimulus bill on Saturday, paving the way for extensions to unemployment benefits, another round of stimulus checks and aid to state and local governments. The Democrat-controlled House is expected to pass the bill later this week. President Joe Biden is expected to sign it into law before unemployment aid programs expire on March 14.
Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday people who’ve been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 can meet safely indoors without masks, further boosting reopening hopes. The positive news boosted stocks banking on a strong economic recovery.
Disney shares added more than 6% after California eased Covid rules, paving the way for Disneyland to reopen on a limited basis in April. American Airlines jumped nearly 5%, while United Airlines popped 7%. Target rose 2.5%.
“More stimulus could provide a big lift to the stock market, but it may come with some bumps,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “Runaway inflation worries have been a stumbling block for stocks as of late. Because of this, there could be more market weakness ahead as investors grapple with the short- and long-term effects of stimulus. High-flying stocks like tech and the ‘stay at home’ stocks may be hit the hardest.”
Tech stocks remained the biggest losers on Monday, continuing the trend for the last few weeks. High-growth stocks, which were among the best performers last year, are particularly vulnerable as higher rates reduce the value of future cash flows.
Apple has fallen 15% in the past month, while Tesla has dropped 34% in that period. Pandemic bets Zoom Video and Peloton have tumbled 24% and 30% over the past month.
Sentiment got a boost earlier Monday after hedge fund manager David Tepper said the recent sharp rise in rates is likely over and it’s hard to be bearish on stocks right now.
“Basically I think rates have temporarily made the most of the move and should be more stable in the next few months, which makes it safer to be in stocks for now,” Tepper told CNBC’s Joe Kernen, who shared the comments on “Squawk Box.”
The benchmark 10-year yield has risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of more stimulus on top of a booming economic recovery. The 10-year Treasury yield
rose 4 basis points to 1.6% Monday. The benchmark rate started the calendar year below the 1% mark.
Tepper believes the sell-off in Treasurys that has driven rates higher is likely over as big foreign buyers like Japan are poised to come in. He also said “bellwether” stocks like Amazon
 are starting to look attractive after the pullback. Amazon shares have fallen 11% over the past month.
The market rotation has created a big divergence among the major averages. For March, the Dow Industrials, leveraged more to the reopening, is up 2.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite is off by 4.4%. Meanwhile, the broader S&P 500 is up 0.3%."
"Dow rallies 570 points in big turnaround, Nasdaq ends wild day 1.6% higher",EST-20214:24-PM,"The Labor Department on Friday reported that nonfarm payrolls jumped by 379,000 for the month and the unemployment rate fell to 6.2%. That compared to expectations of 210,000 new jobs and the jobless rate to hold steady from the 6.3% rate in January, according to Dow Jones.
Stocks that would benefit from a rapid economic comeback jumped in the wake of the jobs report. The S&P 500 energy sector popped 3.9%, posting its best day since November. Occidental Petroleum jumped 4.5%, while Devon Energy rallied 8.4%. Financials and materials rose more than 2% each.
“Today’s employment report confirmed an economy poised for a broader reopening,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates trading at AmeriVet Securities. “The quick selloff in US 10-year rates following today’s employment report was met with good buying around the 1.60% level, lending support to equity and credit markets throughout the day.”
Still, the spike in interest rates fueled fears that growth-oriented tech companies, which had led the market rally last year, may have a hard time living up to expectations if borrowing costs jump. Tesla tumbled more than 3%, bringing its weekly losses to 11%. Although the stock closed well off its Friday lows.
Pandemic winners Peloton and Zoom Video slid 12% and 9%, respectively, this week. Red-hot investor Cathie Wood, who focuses on innovative companies, saw her flagship fund lose double digits this week and wipe out its 2021 gains.
Despite Friday’s rebound, the Nasdaq fell more than 2% this week, and the tech-heavy benchmark briefly turned negative on the year. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% this week, snapping a two-week losing streak. The blue-chip Dow outperformed with a 1.8% weekly gain as investors bet on the recovery.
Friday’s moves followed a steep sell-off on Thursday triggered by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks on rising bond yields. The Fed chair said the recent runup caught his attention but he didn’t give any indication of how the central bank would rein it in. Some investors had expected Powell to signal his willingness to adjust the Fed’s asset purchase program.
The economic reopening could “create some upward pressure on prices,” Powell said in a Wall Street Journal webinar Thursday. Even if the economy sees “transitory increases in inflation … I expect that we will be patient,” he added.

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.6% to 12,920.15 as Apple climbed 1% and Microsoft gained 2%. At its low of the day, the tech-heavy benchmark dropped 2.6%.
The major averages bounced off their lows as bond yields retreated from their session highs. The 10-year Treasury yield eased back to 1.55% after popping above 1.6% to touch a 2021 high following data showing a surge in jobs growth.
“Yields ticked down from the move earlier, and that helped underpin the market’s climb higher,” said Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chief market strategist. “As tech names were moving into correction territory, by most measures the tech sell-off had reached oversold levels and were due for investors and traders to begin buying.”"

Apple gained 3%. Netflix climbed 2.2%. Facebook and Amazon rose 1.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Alphabet closed 0.6% higher, and Microsoft was up by 2.6%.
American Express fell 4.2% to lead the Dow lower. Boeing and Disney both lost at least 3%.
Wednesday’s moves came after strong back-to-back strong sessions for the Dow that were sparked by Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement about their more than 90% effective Covid-19 vaccine.
The news caused investors to move out of technology names and stay-at-home stocks and into cyclical stocks that hinge on a recovering economy.
“An abrupt macro positive shock such as we saw this week can lift all value stocks for a time,” Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, co-head of the portfolio strategy team at Bernstein, wrote in a note. “However, we think that the outlook for the next year has to be more nuanced.”
Fraser-Jenkins noted there is “still a greater longevity of growth” for major technology companies.
Tech and consumer discretionary, the worst-performing sectors this week, outperformed on Wednesday. Tech was up by more than 2%, and consumer discretionary gained 1.5%.
The best-performing sectors this week, energy and financials, lagged. Energy was down 0.8%, while financials lost 0.5%. Energy remains up more than 16% week to date despite Wednesday’s decline; financials are still 8.4% higher over that time period.
“What you saw this week really encapsulated what the market is focused on,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates trading at AmeriVet Securities. “You certainly saw a dramatic reaction in the equity market, and the bond market was pulled into that as well.”
The bond market was closed Wednesday due to the Veterans Day holiday. Earlier this week, however, the 10-year Treasury yield hit its highest level since March as traders sold Treasurys.
The vaccine and antibody drug news comes as the United States once again topped its prior day record of daily new Covid-19 infections, on a seven-day average, while also crossing the bleak milestone of more than 10 million cases nationwide on Monday. The seven-day average of daily new cases Monday was 108,964, a 37% increase from a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University."
Nasdaq releases its top 25 ETFs for the last week and month — here’s what’s working,EDT-20204:56-PM,"The Nasdaq uses a combination score for its ranking that considers four factors: the ETF’s potential for return, or how much it moves; its inflows and outflows; how many of its shares trade (above-average share counts get priority) and its ability to grow assets in absolute terms.
With ETFs accounting for about 40% of the value traded during the March sell-off, according to Nasdaq Economics Research, the rankings have shed light on buyers’ strategies, Phil Mackintosh, Nasdaq’s chief economist, told CNBC’s “ETF Edge” on Monday.
“You’ve really seen a cycling of investor appetite,” Mackintosh said. “Back in March when everything was a rush for cash, there was a lot of trading by the experts that use ETFs, and it’s sophisticated retail [investors] as well as sophisticated hedge funds.”
But while home construction, regional banking and oil services ETFs topped the Nasdaq’s 1-month ranking, the 1-week ranking shows some previously lagging trades coming back into favor, Mackintosh said.
“We’ve seen value, we’ve seen small cap[s] and we’ve seen a lot of trading into international markets because they’ve been stretched on the downside, probably oversold,” he said. “As we see people getting back to work, as we see Europe getting back to work and not seeing a case spike, it makes sense to start to think about whether those economies might recover a little bit more quickly than the U.S. market.”
Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Trends, interpreted this week’s ranking as more and more buyers trying to call a bottom in various market groups.
“We’ve seen things with USO when people were trying to call the bottom in oil. We saw that with JETS when people were trying to call the bottom in airlines,” Nadig said in the same “ETF Edge” interview.
The United States Oil Fund
(USO), which is popular among retail investors, went through a series of structural changes to stave off collapse in April as the oil futures it trades plunged into negative territory. It has been on a steady incline since the end of April, while JETS has taken off since mid-May.
USO climbed less than 1% in Tuesday’s trading session, while JETS shares fell nearly 8%.
“I think it’s a mistake to think that the billion dollars that has flowed into [JETS] is all mom-and-pop investors,” Nadig said. “That’s not what we see in the 13F filings. It’s not what we see on the tape. It’s clear there are some very sophisticated folks out there, most likely hedge funds, using this. It’s a well-constructed fund if you’re trying to play the airline industry.”
Even so, Nadig wasn’t surprised to see “bottom-fishing” in ETFs tracking beaten-up groups such as the small caps, oil plays or financial services stocks.
“We’re seeing it in every sector that got heavily beaten-up in the worst of it in March,” Nadig said. “We just had the Russell [2000]
cross its 200-day moving average to the upside. When we talk about financials, we’re seeing a bunch of those stocks come back. Value. All of these are, as Phil pointed out, these kinds of reversal plays. And sure, there’s definitely some retail participation there, but I think it would be a mistake to think that this is just pajama pants traders.”

Nasdaq cracks down on IPOs of small Chinese companies,EDT-20199:52-AM,"Following the listing rule changes, small Chinese IPOs have experienced longer waiting times and scrutiny from Nasdaq before they are allowed to proceed with their IPOs, according to corporate and investment banking sources.
For example, Xuezhu Wang, CEO of Happiness Biotech Group
, a Chinese company that manufactures and sells nutraceuticals, told Reuters he promised Nasdaq to secure at least 30% of the IPO proceeds from U.S. investors, in order to be allowed to list.
As most of the small Chinese companies pursuing U.S. IPOs have no U.S. business presence or brand recognition, hiring U.S. citizens as board members is now being adopted as a tactic to get listings approved, Chinese executives and investment bankers say.
China Xiangtai Food, a pork processing company based in Chongqing City in southwest China, had to add two U.S. citizens to its board of directors to be allowed by Nasdaq to complete its IPO in August 2019, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Xiangtai did not respond to a request for comments.
The New York Stock Exchange, the other major U.S. stock exchange, operated by Intercontinental Exchange
, is looking closely at Chinese listings, according to a source familiar with the matter. However, it has yet to introduce rule changes similar to Nasdaq.
“The New York Stock Exchange has a longstanding commitment to good governance, rigorously adhering to both the letter and spirit of our listing standards,” a New York Stock Exchange spokesman said.Chinese companies have raised over 70 billion in the U.S. stock market since 2000, according to Refinitiv data. While the biggest ones, such as e-commerce giants Alibaba
, Pingduoduo
and JD.com
, have attracted major U.S. stock market investors, many small ones have proved unpopular.
This is largely due to their poor track record. Shares of Chinese IPOs that raised $200 million or less have traded down 38% on average since their IPO through July 31 in the last 18 months, compared to a rise of 13.9% for U.S. companies of the same size, according to Dealogic data.
Some 19 Chinese companies went public on the Nasdaq in 2018, up from 8 in 2017, based on submissions by investment banks underwriting them to Dealogic.Nasdaq’s new listing rules have raised the average trading volume requirements for a stock, and call for at least 50% of a company’s shareholders to invest a minimum of $2,500 each in an IPO.
Nasdaq also said in June that it may delay the U.S. listing of a company that does not demonstrate a strong enough nexus to the U.S. capital markets, including having no shareholders, operations, management or board members with links to the United States.
Small Chinese firms pursue these IPOs because they allow their founders and backers to cash out, rewarding them with U.S. dollars they cannot easily access because of China’s capital controls. The companies also use their Nasdaq-listed status to convince lenders in China to fund them and often get subsidies from Chinese local authorities for becoming publicly traded.
Unlike Nasdaq, the Chinese stock market has strict listing criteria that prevent some loss-making companies from going public. The geographically adjacent Hong Kong stock exchange is also viewed by IPO hopefuls as more strict compared to Nasdaq.At a time of escalating tensions between the United States and China over trade and technology, Nasdaq’s curbs on small Chinese IPOs represent the latest flash point in the financial relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies fell sharply on Friday following reports that the White House was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. A U.S. Treasury official said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration was not considering blocking Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. stock exchanges “at this time.”
A source close to Nasdaq said the changes to its listing rules were not the result of discussions with the White House. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Nasdaq’s listing rule changes.
In June, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill, which has yet to be adopted, that would force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits, or face delisting.
Nasdaq first proposed changing the listing rules in October 2018, and the changes took effect last month.
“Nasdaq’s concern about low liquidity and high volatility in the marketplace brought about by such Chinese IPOs has become very obvious since mid-2018,” said Ralph De Martino, chair of U.S. law firm Schiff Hardin’s Asia practice, which advises Chinese companies on their IPOs.Nasdaq
is cracking down on initial public offerings (IPOs) of small Chinese companies by tightening restrictions and slowing down their approval, according to regulatory filings, corporate executives and investment bankers.
Nasdaq’s attempt to limit these stock market flotations comes as a growing number of them end up raising most of the capital in their IPO from Chinese sources, rather than from U.S. investors.

The shares of most small Chinese companies trade thinly following their U.S. listing, because most of them stay in the hands of a few insiders. Their low liquidity makes them unattractive to many large institutional investors, to whom Nasdaq is seeking to cater.
For example, when 111
, a Chinese online pharmacy network, raised $100 million in its IPO on Nasdaq last year, shares were mainly sold to connections of the company’s executives, 111 CEO Liu Junling told Reuters in an interview.
Digital influencer incubator Ruhnn Holding
, after-school education provider Puxin
, and pet product manufacturer Dogness International
are other examples of Chinese companies that listed on Nasdaq in the last two years with more investors from China snapping up their shares than from the United States, according to sources close to the companies. Ruhnn, Puxin, and Dogness did not respond to requests for comment.
“One critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies. The statutory obligation of all U.S. equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for U.S. investors,” a Nasdaq spokeswoman said.

Investors jumped back into their favorite tech stocks as optimism about the sector grows ahead of big earnings reports next week for some of the largest names in the space. Salesforce
gained 2.5% while Amazon
and Facebook
climbed 1.4% higher.
“Between interest rates falling, the edge coming off of growth expectations and the COVID resurgence adding to some of the uncertainty, tech stocks look like a natural place that investors and traders are going to gravitate to until we get more resolution along some of these fronts,” said Yung-Yu Ma, BMO Wealth Management’s chief investment strategist.
Microsoft
rose 1.6% after Citi raised its price target, saying the tech giant has the potential to beat Wall Street expectations when it reports quarterly earnings next week. Citi predicted the stock will rise more than 30% over the next year. Apple
rose almost 1% after Canaccord Genuity said there was “strong demand” for Apple products ahead of its earnings next week.
The overall market continues to grind higher, led sometimes by value stocks when economic optimism is high and on days such as Thursday, tech shares take over the lead.
The Dow is up 0.3% on the week and sits less than 1% from a record high, bouncing back from a 700-point-plus rout on Monday.
Some investors believe that reopening plays will once again come back into favor and tech shares will pull back.
“This economy is still in an incredibly strong rebound, corporate revenue and profits are increasing sharply, and it’s a pretty positive backdrop,” said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equities and co-head of multi-asset investing at Lazard Asset Management. “That means interest rates in the bond market are too low and if we start to see the yield curve really steepen, that’s a challenge for the companies that are driven by growth, that hope they’ll make a profit in five to 10 years,” like tech stocks.
“That’s a negative headwind for those companies, and it’s probably a positive story for the stocks traditionally viewed as more value oriented stocks,” he added.
Stocks were under pressure earlier in the day after jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 419,000, higher than the 350,000 economists polled by Dow Jones estimated and more than the upwardly revised 368,000 from the previous period.
The 10-year Treasury yield ticked lower to 1.265% on the poor jobs data. The rate dropped to a 5-month low of 1.17% earlier in the week.
Bank stocks, which are typically viewed as cyclical stocks whose performance is tied to the path of the economy, were down with JPMorgan
, Bank of America
and Wells Fargo
shedding more than 1% each.
Still, a strong second-quarter earnings reporting season continues, with American Airlines
posting a profit for the period, snapping a streak of five straight quarters with losses, thanks to the recovery in travel demand and government aid. The shares are down 1.1% on Thursday. Similarly, Southwest Airlines
reported a quarterly profit, but the carrier’s stock closed 3.4% lower.
Union Pacific
’s shares added more than 1% after the railroad company reported second-quarter net income of $1.8 billion or $2.72 per diluted share. That’s up from $1.1 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter.
CSX
jumped nearly 3.5% after the railroad’s second-quarter profit more than doubled. AT&T
shares climbed about 0.4% after earnings and revenue topped analyst estimates.
Texas Instruments
slid 5.3% after the chipmaker topped expectations for the second quarter, but warned that third-quarter results could fall short of analysts’ estimates.
Intel
, Twitter
, Snap
and Capital One
posted quarterly updates after the market closed.
So far, 15% of the S&P 500 has reported earnings, with 88% beating earnings estimates, according to Refinitiv. Of the companies that have reported, 84% have topped revenue expectations.
“The truth is investors have been very spoiled by the recent stock market performance,” noted LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, we haven’t seen as much as a 5% pullback since October. Although we firmly think this bull market is alive and well, let’s not fool ourselves into thinking trees grow forever. Risk is no doubt increasing as we head into the troublesome August and September months.”

Nasdaq tells Luckin Coffee of plans to delist the stock after sales fraud,EDT-20204:04-PM,"The Nasdaq Stock Market has notified Luckin Coffee
 that it will delist the stock after the company disclosed that its former chief operating officer fabricated sales in 2019. 
Luckin said Tuesday that it plans to request a hearing before a Nasdaq panel.
The Chinese coffee chain will remain listed on the Nasdaq until the panel decides on an outcome. Hearings typically occur between 30 and 45 days after they are requested. It is unclear if the coronavirus pandemic will slow down that timeline. 
The exchange told Luckin that it determined it would be delisted because of public interest concerns raised by the sales fraud disclosed in April and the company’s “past failure to publicly disclose material information.”
Luckin made its public market debut on the Nasdaq more than a year ago, on May 17, 2019.
The company disclosed on April 2 that an internal probe found that Jian Liu, its COO at the time, had fabricated 2019 sales.
Trading of Luckin shares on the Nasdaq has been halted since April 7 for pending news. There is no time limit for how long a stock can be halted for that reason. Its shares had plummeted 83% since disclosing the fraud, putting its market value at $1 billion. 
A week ago, Luckin said that it fired its CEO and COO as part of its internal investigation into the sales fraud. The company said then that the investigation is still ongoing and it is cooperating with regulatory agencies in both the United States and China.
The coffee chain has continued to operate during the probe. 
The  2½-year-old company has tried to build a customer base in China with smaller locations formatted for convenience and offering steep discounts. In January, the company said it had more than 4,500 locations in China, several hundred more than rival Starbucks
. The U.S.-based coffee chain has responded to the competitive threat by opening cafes in China designed for quicker pick up and delivery and less seating. 
U.S. hedge fund Muddy Waters raised allegations of fraud in January and bet against the stock. Luckin denied the claims at the time but still hasn’t said why it started its internal probe.The Nasdaq Stock Market has told Luckin Coffee that it will delist the stock.

Lordstown Motors shares pop in volatile Nasdaq trading debut,EDT-20204:12-PM,"Lordstown was expected to receive about $675 million of gross proceeds from its SPAC deal. It planned to use the funds for the production of a new work truck called the Endurance. Lordstown says it has secured 40,000 preorders for the truck, which would equate to $2 billion in revenue.
The company plans to begin producing the pickup beginning next year at General Motors’
former Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio. Lordstown purchased it from the automaker last year. Deliveries are expected to begin in late summer.
The company expects to achieve breakeven or better operational earnings margins in 2022, its first full year of production, and eclipse 10% by 2024.
Lordstown has received major boosts in public awareness recently thanks to the Trump administration, including visits with President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.

Ohio-based Lordstown Motors is among a growing group of electric vehicle start-ups going public through deals with SPACs, which have become a popular way of raising money on Wall Street because they have a more streamlined regulatory process than traditional initial public offerings.
SPAC stocks typically get an initial pop after the deal is announced but tend to underperform the broader market in the long run, according to Goldman Sachs. Share prices of Hyliion

The market is “exhibiting a very strong pro-growth/momentum bias,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, in a note. “The pivot away from cyclicals (which had been leading for the last two weeks) could reflect reduced near-term odds for fiscal stimulus and spiking COVID cases, but the core macro narrative in the US is still intensely focused on the possibility for a ‘Blue Wave.’”
Monday’s rally came even as chances for another round of stimulus before the election appeared to dim over the weekend. Both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Republicans pushed back on a $1.8 trillion offer from the White House.
In a letter to colleagues, Pelosi highlighted what she said were insufficient offers on healthcare issues.
“The news is filled with the numbers in terms of dollars. The heart of the matter is: can we allow the virus to rage on and ignore science as the Administration proposes, or will they accept the scientific strategic plan in the Heroes Act to crush the virus,” Pelosi said, referring to a bill that Democrats already passed in the House.
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows called for a separate vote on the Paycheck Protection Program in their own letter to Congress on Sunday.
The apparent impasse follows a whirlwind week in Washington that saw President Donald Trump at one point call off negotiations, saying that Congressional Republicans should focus on confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the vacant Supreme Court seat. Trump then reversed his position and said to “go big” in negotiations.
But Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” he thinks “there’s enough stimulus in the pipeline for now to kind of get us through year-end without causing a risk of a double-dip recession, and ultimately, no matter who wins the election, by the first quarter we’ll have an additional stimulus that’s probably still required to make sure that the recovery continues.”
Wall Street was coming off a strong performance last week. The Dow posted its biggest one-week gain since August, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite
had their best week since July.
“Markets last week appeared to price perceived election clarity, and with it, a growing likelihood of additional fiscal stimulus – at least in the pipeline. This was reflected from small cap outperformance to rising Treasury yields,” Julian Emanuel, BTIG’s chief equity and derivatives strategist, said in a note to clients Sunday.
Investors are also bracing for the third-quarter earnings season. Several major banks and airlines are slated to report their results this week, including JPMorgan Chase
and Delta Air Lines
on Tuesday.
While results for the period are expected to decline significantly, traders believe the results could come in much better than expected.

Payrolls for May were also revised to a gain of more than 3 million from a loss of 2.76 million. 
Meanwhile, The Institute for Supply Management said U.S. manufacturing activity grew to its highest level since April 2019, recovering from a sharp contraction in May. 
“Looking ahead, we will likely see continued improvement in July,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies, regarding the manufacturing data. “The recent spikes in COVID cases in various states across the country have only very recently resulted in walk-backs of reopening plans, and the majority of those policy changes have focused on social settings rather than anything to do with manufacturing.”
Those data sets were released ahead of the U.S. government’s monthly jobs report, which is scheduled for release Thursday at 8:30 a.m.
To be sure, the Federal Reserve’s June meeting minutes showed the central bank thinks the economy will need monetary policy support “for some time” as the country tries to recover from the pandemic. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street” that Pfizer is seen as credible so investors will like the news. “This is highly unlike Pfizer ... I, frankly, don’t want to accept it like this, but the market will and it’s kind of a saved-by-Pfizer market from where we were,” said Cramer.
Pfizer and BioNTech’s news comes as more than 12 states have now paused or rolled back their reopenings, with cases in the U.S. jumping 40% over the past week to an average of about 39,750 on Monday, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. 
Arizona on Wednesday reported nearly 4,900 additional coronavirus cases and 88 new deaths, a record-high single-day jump. California also reported a record spike in new coronavirus cases. Apple, meanwhile, erased earlier gains and closed 0.2% lower after announcing it will re-close 30 more stores do to the resurgence in virus cases. 
White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that if the outbreak continues at its current pace, daily new cases could surpass 100,000 new infections per day.
Shares of Amazon and Netflix — companies that benefit from people staying at home — led the way higher, rising 4.4% and 6.7%, respectively. FedEx was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500, rallying 11.7% on the back of stronger-than-forecast earnings. 
“We just see this ongoing push-and-pull between reopening [the economy] and the virus,” said Tom Hainlin, global investment strategist at Ascent Private Capital Management. “We got some positive early stage vaccine data from Pfizer, but you’ve got Google and Citigroup, among other companies, saying they’re going to slow down our process of getting people back to the office because of this resurgence.”
Wall Street was coming off its best quarterly performance in decades. The Dow gained 17.8% in the second quarter, posting its best quarter since 1987, while the S&P 500 finished the period with a near 20% gain, its best since 1998. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 30.6% for the quarter, the most since 1999.
“We continue to expect it to be an uneven process, albeit with a positive trajectory,” Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, said in a note. “The good news is through this digestion period, markets are working off some of the excesses that had built up, and elevated expectations are being reset.”The S&P 500
 and Nasdaq Composite
 started the new quarter with solid gains on Wednesday, with market sentiment getting a lift from positive coronavirus vaccine news and strong U.S. economic data. 
The S&P 500 closed 0.5% higher at 3,115.86. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posted a record closing high, rising 0.95% to 10,154.63. The Nasdaq-100 index — which is made up of the composite’s 100-largest nonfinancial stocks —jumped more than 1% to an all-time high and closed at 10,279.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, falling 77.91 points, or 0.3%, to 25,734.97.
A study of a coronavirus vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech showed the drug created neutralizing antibodies. The results were released online, but have not been reviewed by a medical journal yet. 
“We are encouraged by the clinical data of BNT162b1, one of four mRNA constructs we are evaluating clinically, and for which we have positive, preliminary, topline findings,” said Kathrin U. Jansen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, in a release.
The company also said that, if the vaccine gets regulatory approval, it expects to make up to 100 million doses by year-end and “potentially” more than 1.2 billion by the end of 2021. Pfizer shares jumped 3.2% on the news and BioNTech’s U.S.-listed shares fell 3.9%, erasing earlier gains into the close. "

 on Thursday posted a first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ expectations, but the firm’s trading desks generated about $700 million more revenue than expected. The bank said in a release that earnings dropped 30% to $1.7 billion, or $1.01 a share, compared with the $1.14 estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Shares of Morgan Stanley dipped 0.8% in premarket trading. – Son, LiThe S&P 500 is back to looking expensive, Bank of American equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian said in a note to clients Thursday. Looking at 20 valuation frameworks, including trailing PE, EV/EBITDA and EV/sales, the firm found that the benchmark index is “richer” than average on many of these key metrics. The three exceptions are “lower than average Price to Free Cash Flow, cheaper relative to bonds and relative to gold.” From a momentum and value play standpoint Bank of America said health care, tech and communication services look the best, while materials, energy and consumer discretionary rank the worst. “Today’s valuations suggest S&P 500 annualized 10-yr price returns of 4%-5%. This is lower than average returns in prior decades and roughly half of the 8% annualized price return we’ve enjoyed since post-WWII (1947)…But if we consider total returns of 6% to 8% (assuming a dividend yield of 2% to 3%), US equities’ annualized returns are still very competitive with other similar-in-quality asset class returns,” Subramanian said. —StevensThe Labor Department is scheduled to release at 8:30 a.m. ET its report on the number of Americans who filed for state unemployment benefits last week. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect initial claims for the week ended April 11 to total 5 million, a decline from 6.6 million in the prior week but still an eye-popping number on a historical basis. Thursday’s release could see the U.S. economy clinch an important milestone amid the coronavirus outbreak: the erasure of all of the nonfarm job gains since the throes of the Great Recession and financial crisis if claims exceed 5.662 million. — FranckStaffers for Sen.

West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, rose 19 cents to trade at $20.06, while international benchmark Brent crude traded $1.03 higher at $28.72 per barrel. If WTI can hold onto its gains throughout the session, it will be the contract’s first positive day in 5. Oil moved lower on Wednesday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that inventory surged by a record 19.2 million barrels for the week ending April 10 as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sap demand. Additionally, the IEA said in its monthly report that oil demand could fall by 29 million barrels per day in April, driving demand to its lowest level in 25 years. On Sunday OPEC and its allies announced a record 9.7 million bpd production cut beginning on May 1, but the move has done little to assuage traders’ fears about the slowdown in demand. Since the deal was finalized on Sunday WTI has dropped more than 12%. – StevensThe market’s rip-roaring rally off the March 23 lows has lost some momentum in recent days, technical strategist Mark Newton said in a note. “While the trends remain quite positive near-term, there has been some slowdown in both breadth and momentum … and the rally into Tuesday’s highs ahead of Wednesday’s decline showed definite signs of negative momentum divergence while breadth has gotten weaker.” The major averages all rose more than 2% on Tuesday, but then dropped over 1% on Wednesday.

“The takeaway is that markets DO show evidence of some internal issues that “could” lead to a decline. However, this also could simply lead to minor consolidation that ends up leading equities higher into late April,” said Newton, managing member of Newton Advisors. —ImbertJeff Bezos on Thursday published Amazon’s annual shareholder letter, in which he detailed how the company has responded to the coronavirus pandemic so far. Bezos stressed the importance of testing in order for the public to return to work, as well as for his own employees to be protected from the virus. He pointed to Amazon’s efforts to develop “incremental testing capacity,” which the company announced last week. As part of that announcement, Amazon said it hopes to begin testing all of its employees, including those who show no symptoms. “Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running,” Bezos said. “For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available.” – PalmerThe Labor Department said a total of 5.245 million Americans filed for state unemployment benefits for the week ended April 11, versus the Dow Jones estimate of 5 million. The number marks a decline from 6.6 million in the prior week. The new filings bring the crisis total to just over 22 million, nearly wiping out all the job gains since the Great Recession. —LiTom Lee, founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, says the market bottom is likely in after the S&P 500 retraced half of its downside move from Feb. 19 to March 23. “We are in a bull market recovery, as bizarre as it sounds,” Lee wrote in a note to clients. “The market has shifted into the hands of “buyers” whereas sellers were in complete control from 2/19/2020 to 3/23/2020.” —ImbertWith airplanes grounded worldwide, United Airlines said that it would cut its May schedule by 90%. “To help you understand how few people are flying in this environment, less than 200,000 people flew with us during the first two weeks of April this year, compared to more than 6 million during the same time in 2019, a 97 percent drop,” CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement. “We expect to fly fewer people during the entire month of May than we did on a single day in May 2019,” he added. Munoz said the airline would also likely scale back its June schedule, while also warning about possible job cuts. United

This is a drop from the 1.599 million starts reported for the previous month. – FitzgeraldNetflix’s stock has more room to run, poised to get a boost by the streaming platform’s blowout earnings next week, according to Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street firm hiked its 12-month price target on Netflix to $490 per share from $430 per share, implying nearly 15% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $426.75 per share. Goldman’s new price target makes it tied on the Street for the highest forecast on Netflix, according to FactSet. Pivotal also has a $490 target price. “As one of the few companies experiencing increased demand in the current environment, we expect shares will continue to outperform,” Goldman Sachs equity analyst Health Terry said in a note to clients. Plus, Goldman has high hopes for the streaming company’s earnings next week. “We expect Netﬂix to report 1Q results well above guidance, with over 10mn net subscriber additions, and provide initial guidance for 2Q ahead of FactSet Consensus,” said Terry. Goldman believes Netflix will report 10.3 million total paid subscribers in the first quarter, well ahead of guidance of 7 million and consensus of 7.8 million. – FitzgeraldBucking the trend in corporate America, Costco

The loans, which can turn into grants if they are largely used for payroll expenses, were distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.
The Small Business Administration tapped banks around the country to help operate the program, and many banks complained that the guidance for the loans was not clear, leading the banks to start processing applications at different times.

Redemptions in long-term funds totaled $326 billion for the month, or about 2% of total assets, according to Morningstar. That was by far the biggest month ever, dwarfing the Great Recession peak of $104 billion in October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers failed. Despite the washout out in stocks, which ended the longest bull market run in history, investors put a net $10.5 billion in equity-based funds. The biggest contributor to outflows came from taxable bonds, which saw $240.3 billion in redemptions. Money market funds saw a record $685 billion in inflows, bringing total assets in the safe haven to $4.3 trillion. – CoxStreaming platform Netflix

The Dow dipped about 50 points, or 0.2%. —ImbertWith the latest 5.2 million weekly jobless claims, Citigroup says the 21.5 million claims in the past four weeks is equal to about a 13 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate to about 17%. But Citi economists say the April unemployment rate is more likely to be between 10% and 15%. That’s because some workers will show up as no longer looking for a job in the monthly government report, if they were furloughed and have returned or plan to return to their jobs. Claims may have peaked in the past two weeks, but the economists say it’s hard to determine whether that is so. Some firms will have to rehire by late June to have loans from the Paycheck Protection Program forgiven. They expect the unemployment rate to peak in April or May and then decline rapidly as  rehiring occurs and businesses start to reopen.— DommShares of Walmart

"S&P 500 ends volatile day slightly higher, Apple pushes Nasdaq to another record close",EST-20214:09-PM,"The S&P 500 erased earlier losses and rose slightly to a record on Monday as investors prepared for a busy week of earnings featuring reports from the largest tech companies.
The broad equity benchmark closed the volatile day 0.4% higher at a new record close of 3,855.36. The S&P 500 fell 1.2% at its low of the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7% to reach a fresh closing high of 13,635.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, less susceptible to changes in technology shares, dipped 36.98 points, or 0.1%, to 30,960.00. At its session low, the 30-stock benchmark dropped more than 400 points.
This coming week, 13 Dow components and 111 S&P 500 companies are set to report earnings. Among the quarterly reports on deck include those from Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Tesla, McDonald’s, Honeywell, Caterpillar and Boeing.
Apple shares gained 2.8% to an all-time high before its quarterly report Wednesday after the bell. Tesla, which also reports Wednesday, popped 4% to hit a record.
“The Street is anticipating robust results from Apple on Wednesday after the bell with Cupertino expected to handily beat Street estimates across the board,” wrote Dan Ives of Wedbush, who raised his 12-month price target on Monday to $175. “While the Street is forecasting roughly 220 million iPhone units [for 2021], we believe based on the current trajectory and in a bull case Cupertino has potential to sell north of 240 million units.”
Highly speculative action in stocks like GameStop
was unnerving some investors, causing worry that parts of the market had detached from fundamentals and could cause the broader market to take a hit when the mania ends.
Shares of the brick-and-mortar video-game retailer soared more than 140% to top $150 at one point Monday as a slew of retail investors active in online chat rooms aimed to squeeze out short sellers. GameStop briefly turned negative in wild trading before closing 18% higher. Other heavily shorted names, including Bed Bath & Beyond, also jumped higher on Monday amid the buying frenzy.
“Signs of excess continue to concern investors, with markets at near-record highs on a variety of valuation metrics,” said Mark Hackett, Nationwide’s chief of investment research. “Other signs of extreme optimism include put-call ratios, credit spreads and momentum indicators.”  
Companies kicked off the earnings season on a strong note. Of the S&P 500 components that have already reported earnings, 73% have beaten on both sales and EPS, according to data from Bank of America. The firm said this is tracking similar to last quarter when the number of companies beating hit a record.
Wall Street was coming off a winning week amid the strength in the technology sector. The Dow and the S&P 500 gained 0.6% and 1.9%, respectively. The Nasdaq advanced 4.19% last week for its best week since November as shares of Big Tech names pushed the index to a record.
The move higher came as President Joe Biden tries to push through a $1.9 trillion stimulus program that many congressional Republicans oppose. The fiscal aid includes direct checks to millions of Americans, aid to state and local governments, funding for Covid vaccines and testing, a boost to the minimum wage and enhanced unemployment benefits, among other things.
The number of coronavirus cases continues to tick up in the U.S. and abroad, but many economists are forecasting a return to growth later this year.
“We continue to expect that a reduction in virus risk due to mass vaccination coupled with fiscal support for consumer spending will lead to a mid-year consumption boom and very strong growth in 2021,” Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients over the weekend.
However, the firm noted that while risks like insufficient fiscal aid look now look less likely, other risks remain. Hatzius cited consumers remaining more cautious than expected as well as the evolution of a vaccine-resistant virus strain as potential future headwinds for the market.

Amazon and three other most loved Nasdaq 100 stocks have seen September slumps,EDT-20208:27-AM,"“These are great companies but sometimes they get so far ahead of themselves that they need a pretty significant pullback before they become great value,” said Maley.
Though lower this month, those stocks have outperformed benchmarks this year. Amazon and PayPal have risen more than 60% in 2020.
The momentum space highlights a big difference between the have and have-nots, said Michael Bapis, managing director of Vios Advisors at Rockfeller Capital Management.
“There’s a really big disparity between growth and value. So I think part of the issue you’re having is you’re seeing a growth-to-value-sector rotation over the next six months,” Bapis said during the same “Trading Nation” segment.
There has been a clear tilt toward growth this year: The IVW growth ETF
has risen 15%, while the IVE value ETF
has fallen 16%.
“There is a wide disparity there and then even within tech, you’re seeing a disparity between some of these companies you mentioned, and the tech value stocks — companies like IBM
, Intel
— they’re trading at, you know, 10 to 12 to 15 times earnings. For a tech company those are very, very attractive levels,” Bapis said.

Amazon
, PayPal
, Alphabet
and Facebook
— the stocks with the most buy ratings on the Nasdaq 100
— have all fallen by double digits this month as sell-offs brought high-flying momentum names to a halt. For example, Amazon has 44 buy ratings but has fallen more than 12% this month.
Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, does not see a pullback as deep as the dot-com bubble for these stocks. However, he does expect the group to fall further.
“These stocks have just become ridiculously overbought, overloved, overowned and overvalued. They got to such extremes at the beginning of the month that they have to work off more than they have already, in my opinion, to really see the kind of bounce or kind of meaningful bottom that a lot of people are looking for,” Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday.
He expects these stocks to drop by 5% to 10% more before hitting bottom. Alphabet, for example, would need to fall to $1,350 before it reaches an oversold condition, Maley said. That also marks a key support level since the June lows."

advanced 140.48 points, or 0.5%, to 27,288.18.
Tuesday marked the first time in five days that the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted a daily gain. The Dow also snapped a three-day losing streak. 
Amazon shares rose 5.7% — their biggest one-day rally since July 20 — after a Bernstein analyst upgraded the e-commerce giant to buy from hold, noting the recent pullback offers an attractive “entry point” for investors. Facebook and Microsoft were both up more than 2% along with Alphabet shares. Netflix gained 0.8%.
Traders also digested remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who reiterated the central bank will support the economy “for as long as it takes.” Powell added that, while the path forward “continues to be highly uncertain,” economic activity has “picked up.”
The major averages were lower earlier in the day after U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced further restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. He noted the country was at a “perilous turning point” and ordered bars and restaurants to close between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The restrictions also expand the list of places requiring people wear a mask. 
“Coronavirus concerns have resurfaced, worrying investors that a reversal in reopening progress could be near,” Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Invest, said in a note. “More and more uncertainty is arising as we get closer to the election but no closer to Congressional fiscal relief. But we’re still optimistic this dip will be bought sooner rather than later.”
Wall Street was coming off a sharp drop in the previous session, with the Dow posting its biggest one-day loss since Sept. 8 on Monday. 
Those losses were driven in part by the prospects of further U.S. coronavirus fiscal stimulus becoming bleaker as lawmakers brace for a potentially bitter Supreme Court confirmation fight as President Donald Trump rushes to nominate a successor to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday.
September has been a tough month on Wall Street. The S&P 500 is down more than 5% month to date and the Nasdaq has dropped 6.9% in that time. The Dow has lost 4% in September. 
“There’s no reason to think this won’t keep being a choppy market,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Coronavirus overshadow everything right now. There’s not end date for that. You don’t know when you’ll get a resolution to that.”

"Nasdaq closes at another record as Big Tech jumps ahead of earnings, S&P 500 ekes out new high",EST-20214:17-PM,"The Nasdaq Composite rose to another record on Thursday as investors bet on strong earnings from big tech companies next week.
The tech-heavy benchmark climbed 0.6% to close at a new high of 13,530.91 as Apple shares popped 3.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 12.37 points to 31,176.01, after touching an intraday record earlier in the day. The S&P 500 gained less than 0.1% to 3,853.07, eking out another fresh high.
Apple’s jump came after top analyst Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley said she expects a record December quarter print for the tech giant. Optimism is rising that major technology companies will impress Wall Street when they hand in earnings reports next week. Apple and Facebook have risen 7.7% and 8.6%, respectively, this week ahead of their quarterly results, while Microsoft has gained 5.8%.
Equities closed at record highs in the previous session as President Joe Biden was sworn into office, ushering in hope that an improved vaccine rollout will ensure a smoother and faster reopening. Some on Wall Street are optimistic that Biden’s plans to combat the pandemic will give the stock market a further boost through 2021.
Biden released details of his Covid plan on his first full day in office, including 10 executive orders and his intent to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up protective equipment production. Biden will seek to accelerate the rollout of vaccines by providing more local and state funding, creating more vaccination sites and launching a national education campaign.
“We see the pace of vaccinations as a key driver of equities through 2021, similar to how shifts in mobility and Covid cases drove equities in 2020,” Keith Parker, head of equity strategy at UBS, said in a note. “Removing bottlenecks for administering doses would present an upside case near-term.”
Still, the big run-up also lifted valuations to historically high levels, making investors cautious about a potential pullback ahead. The S&P 500 has gained 2.6% so far in the new year, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has climbed nearly 5% during the same period.
The S&P 500 is currently trading at 22.8 times forward earnings, near levels during the 2000 dotcom bubble, according to FactSet. The broad equity benchmark is also 16% above the 200-day moving average, twice the normal levels even in bull markets.
“The most recent rally in the stock market should see (at least) a sideways breather over the very-near-term,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said in an email. “The breadth in the market place was quite poor during the rally.”

"Nasdaq hits records, but more than half of stocks are still in bear market",EST-20207:07-AM,"There’s a major disconnect in the Nasdaq
rally.
While the broad index sits at record highs, under the surface more than half of its stocks are in a bear market – characterized by a drop of 20% or more from 52-week highs.
“The Nasdaq has been really strong from a momentum perspective, but the leadership has been relatively narrow,” Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
Mega-cap stocks such as Apple
, Microsoft
 and Amazon
have been responsible for much of the Nasdaq’s rally. But, the charts may be signaling that more Nasdaq stocks could be about to join in on the rally, Stockton said.
“Believe it or not, breadth for the Nasdaq, while it usually is disadvantaged compared to the NYSE, has not been that bad. We saw it range-bound for much of 2019 but a breakout in Q4, and that breakout supports greater expansion in the participation among Nasdaq stocks as we see the market resume its uptrend, whether it happens now or a couple weeks from now once the pullback runs its course,” said Stockton.
That doesn’t mean investors should buy the laggards, though, she cautioned. Align Technology
, Dollar Tree
, Ulta Beauty
, Walgreens
 and Xilinx
are among the stocks that are sharply off their highs and deep in a bear market.
“As a technician, I’m not comfortable buying downtrends unless you see some kind of basing phase. In fact, one of the ones mentioned, Align Technology, we’ve had on our list of recommendations on the short side, and we have that there because it met some resistance, lost some momentum within its downtrend. So I’d say generally speaking, we try to avoid the stocks that are in long-term downtrends and really find the stocks that are exhibiting leadership,” said Stockton.
Orthodontic tech company Align has added 10% in the past 12 months, a fraction of the nearly 30% gain on the broader Nasdaq.
During the same “Trading Nation” segment, John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, said the Nasdaq stocks in a bear market could continue to grind lower.
“There’s two functions going on,” he said. “One is valuation and the other is fundamentals. Growth stocks have rallied hard, and expectations for future cash flows got far ahead of themselves. So, there are some stocks on the [bear market] list where it’s purely a valuation call and if momentum does come out of growth, those stocks are going to continue to have pressure.”
He added that these stocks are also getting hit on fundamentals. Xilinx, for instance, has seen an a chip pricing war ratcheting higher, while excess big-box retail expansion could crimp Dollar Tree.

DocuSign rises as it gets ready to replace United Airlines in Nasdaq 100,EDT-20204:03-PM,"DocuSign
shares were up as much as 8.7% and closed up 8% on Monday after Nasdaq announced Friday that the electronic signature software company would replace United Airlines
on the Nasdaq 100 index. The stock reached a new all-time high and posted its biggest increase since May 29.
The company will join cloud companies Adobe
, Workday
and Zoom Video Communications
on the index, reflecting the rise of cloud services as companies opt for systems they don’t need to operate on their own data center infrastructure.
DocuSign, which competes with Adobe’s Sign and Dropbox’s
HelloSign, debuted on the Nasdaq in 2018. The company’s results beat analysts’ estimates for the quarter that ended on April 30 as it projected $1.32 billion in revenue for its full fiscal year, which ends in January 2021, implying 35% growth. DocuSign remains unprofitable.
In the quarter DocuSign saw some benefits from the coronavirus pandemic as people needed to sign documents while they couldn’t meet in person.
“Even when the Covid-19 situation is behind us, we don’t anticipate customers returning to paper or manual-based processes,” CEO Dan Springer told analysts on a conference call.
DocuSign will become a component of the index on June 22, according to a statement.

"Dow jumps more than 300 points, Nasdaq rebounds nearly 2% from worst week since March",EDT-20204:52-PM,"“Part of this move is from renewed hope for a vaccine,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “That’s giving the market a ray of hope.”
“September has thus far lived up to its reputation, but I think that’s reversing again,” Cardillo said. 
All 11 S&P 500 sectors were higher on Monday. Real estate and tech led the way as they rose more than 2% each. Overall, seven of the 11 sectors were up more than 1%.
The S&P 500 fell by 2.5% last week, marking the broader-market index’s worst one-week drop since June 26. That decline also marked the first time since May that the S&P 500 closed lower for two straight weeks. The benchmark is down 4.6% this month.
Those losses were driven in large part by a steep drop in tech, the best-performing market sector year to date. The S&P 500 tech sector plunged more than 4% for its biggest weekly loss since March. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was hit the hardest last week, down 4%.
“The excessive technology froth from August has been wiped away, but in its wake, clear and ominous topping patterns … developed,” said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, in a note.

climbed 1.3%, or 42.57 points, to 3,383.54 and the Nasdaq Composite
jumped 1.9%, or 203.11 points, to 11,056.65. The tech-heavy benchmark was coming off its worst week since March. 
Shares of Apple jumped 3%. The market has been following in the footsteps of its rally leader. Apple shares are still down 10.6% this month.
Tesla shares rebounded 12.6%. The once-surging stock is down more than 15% in September after it failed to gain entry into the benchmark S&P 500, something investors were anticipating.
Tech sentiment was lifted by news of Nvidia
buying chipmaker Arm Holdings from SoftBank for $40 billion. Nvidia will finance the deal through a combination of cash and common stock. Nvidia popped 5.8%. Other chipmakers also gained, including AMD, Micron and Skyworks.
Meanwhile, ByteDance rejected Microsoft’s bid to buy TikTok’s U.S. operations. Instead, ByteDance has chosen Oracle
to be TikTok’s U.S. technology partner, and Oracle will take a significant stake in the business. Oracle shares were up 4.3%.
Outside of tech, Gilead said it will acquire Immunomedics to expand its cancer treatments for $21 billion. Immunomedics shares doubled. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF
climbed more than 5%.
Sentiment was also boosted by signs of progress toward a coronavirus vaccine. AstraZeneca
 resumed phase three trials for its coronavirus vaccine in the U.K. following a halt due to safety concerns. However, its trials in the U.S. remains on hold as American regulators investigate the side effects flagged in the U.K. study, Reuters reported Monday.

"S&P 500 and Nasdaq close slightly higher, led by tech shares",EST-20214:13-PM,"The S&P 500
and Nasdaq Composite
closed slightly higher on Wednesday, led by tech shares, as traders kept an eye on interest rates, the political uncertainty coming out of Washington and a still raging pandemic.
The broader market index gained 0.2% to end the day at 3,809.84, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 0.4% to 13,128.95. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed just 8.22 points lower, or 0.03%, at 31,060.47.
Intel jumped nearly 7% on news that CEO Bob Swan would step down, effective Feb. 15. Other tech-related names also caught a bid, with Netflix and Amazon popping 2.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Apple also closed higher by more than 1%.
Wednesday’s moves came as U.S. Treasury rates eased from their March highs. The benchmark 10-year note yield fell more than 5 basis points to 1.092%. The 30-year bond yield also fell on Wednesday to 1.823%. On Tuesday, the benchmark rate traded as high as 1.187%.
Despite this decline, the 10-year rate remains more than 15 basis points above its 2020 close of 0.92%.
Given the rise in rates this year, Credit Suisse recommended that investors favor pro-cyclical sectors, including financials and energy. Rising rates could hurt growth stocks, however, which have been the market stalwarts during the pandemic.
“Overall, we believe the rate backdrop will stabilize as investors acclimate to the shift in inflation expectations,” wrote UBS credit strategist Frank Sileo in a note. “We continue to expect modest gains in 2021.”
Expectations for additional fiscal stimulus is one of the reasons behind the steady move higher in yields. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to release details on his economic plan on Thursday.
Wall Street was coming off a muted session as the major averages paused on their recent run to record highs.
“The market rally has taken a break this week,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. He noted, however, that “sentiment and risk indicators continue to reflect investor optimism, with credit spreads at their tightest level since before the pandemic, fear & greed indicators at elevated levels, and the put/call ratio near historic lows.”
Meanwhile, turmoil in Washington continues. Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday night he will not remove President Donald Trump from office. That came before the Democratic-held House approved a resolution urging Pence and the Cabinet to push Trump out of the White House after he incited last week’s riot on the Capitol.
The House of Representatives was voting on Wednesday to impeach Trump for a second time. Trump called on all Americans to help ease political tensions.
Covid cases also continue to increase in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. is recording at least 247,600 new Covid-19 cases and at least 3,340 virus-related deaths each day, based on a seven-day average calculated by CNBC using Johns Hopkins University data.
Still, many say the U.S. is poised to return to growth later this year.
“In 2021, the U.S. economy should experience strong tailwinds from additional fiscal and monetary stimulus coupled with an end to the pandemic’s impact on the economy,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “Pent-up demand in industries impacted by COVID-19 ... and a needed inventory rebuild should further spur job growth,” he added.
Taken together, Schutte said this sets the stage for above-average economic growth, and he sees stocks climbing to new highs.

‘Uber bullish’ tech investor won’t make big moves until the Nasdaq corrects by 20%,EDT-20209:04-PM,"Tech investor Paul Meeks is waiting for the Nasdaq to fall 20% from its record high before making any big moves.
Meeks, who’s known for running the world’s largest tech fund during the late 1990s, believes tech stocks are still too expensive despite this month’s correction.
“For the long-term, I’m uber bullish on tech,” the portfolio manager at Independent Solutions Wealth Management told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “That being said, my concern and really my only concern, is valuation. But it is a pretty big concern.”
With the Nasdaq
on track for its worst week since March 20, Meeks believes another wave of selling could come before the end of the year, dragging popular mega-cap growth names even lower.
He lists the contentious relationship between the U.S. and China as a potential catalyst for another wave of selling.
“Folks don’t realize that the tech supply chain is intertwined between those two nations. It can really never be separated,” said Meeks, who added an escalation of rhetoric particularly around the U.S. presidential election is his biggest worry about the tech sector.
His near-term cautiousness is a stark departure from where he stood just a few months ago. In early June on “Trading Nation, Meeks referred to the group as a safe haven play that was on the cusp of all-time highs. 
Now Meeks, a long-term Apple
 bear, sees the iPhone maker as the marquis tech name facing the most challenges. He believes the stock price is sharply overshooting its multi-year growth prospects.
“Man, it got really expensive a couple of weeks back,” he said. 
Meeks contends overall tech volatility will persist, and he calculates there’s a 50/50 chance the Nasdaq will fall into bear market territory this year. 
Yet, he won’t back away from his multi-year bullish thesis for the group.
“The fundamentals going into Covid, the fundamentals during Covid and the fundamentals coming out of Covid will prove to be superior than the other ten sectors that make up the S&P 500,” Meeks said.
Disclosure: Paul Meeks owns the stocks mentioned, and he is not shorting them.

"Stocks rally to record highs, Nasdaq closes above 13,000 for the first time",EST-20214:24-PM,"On Wednesday, pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol just as lawmakers started the procedural process of counting the Electoral College votes and formally declaring Biden the winner. Still, the Dow and the S&P 500 closed higher on Wednesday as traders looked beyond the event amid increasing prospects for more fiscal stimulus.
“There should be no mystery as to why the markets didn’t care about what happened in the Capital [on Wednesday], however disturbing, disgraceful, and embarrassing it was,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s because it has no bearing on the direction of the economy, earnings and interest rates. It’s that simple.” 
Congress reconvened to continue the process to confirm Biden’s win late Wednesday evening after the Capitol building was secured. That affirmation came early Thursday morning with the House of Representatives and the Senate rejecting efforts to object to the acceptance of the Electoral College votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania.
President Donald Trump said in a statement after the Congress confirmation of Biden that “there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.”
“I think the reason the markets aren’t too flummoxed is it’s not going to change the transition of power,” Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, said.
Traders continued to focus on the possibility for additional fiscal aid after the Democratic party secured a slim majority in the Senate, giving it control of both congressional chambers.
NBC News projected on Wednesday afternoon that Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican David Perdue in one of the two runoff elections in Georgia. Earlier in the day, NBC projected Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in their Georgia runoff.
Georgia’s election results create a 50-50 Senate that Democrats will control, due to the tiebreaking vote in Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. It is widely expected that a Democrat-held Senate would push for a more robust stimulus package, speculation which boosted equities on Wednesday, especially stocks hit hardest during the Covid recession.
JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, said the election results give investors “more clarity” by “solidifying Democrat control in Washington and increasing expectations of more stimulus to come.”
“With the political tensions easing, more stimulus expected to help boost the economy, and coronavirus vaccines helping bring a measure of calm to investors and traders, it seems that the market can now focus on earnings season,” he said.
On the data front, initial jobless claims came in at 787,000 for the week ending Dec. 31, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a print of 815,000.
Sentiment on Wall Street also got a boost after the Institute for Supply Management said its index for nonmanufacturing activity in the U.S. rose to 57.2 in December from 55.9 in November. Economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast a print of 54.5.

S&P’s Tesla snub shows the risks to this overheating Nasdaq trade,EDT-20208:19-AM,"It’s probably too melodramatic to say the public’s appetite for tech threatens to eat the entire market and its major mechanisms. But directionally, it’s a legitimate observation, coming at a time when the growth-stock rally overshot in the short term.
The late-week 6% sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite reflects the two main tactical vulnerabilities: It became grossly over-extended technically and trader positioning grew too crowded on the bullish side. If there needs to be an “equal and opposite” recoil to take care of them, then last week’s setback probably wasn’t enough, but there’s no saying this is necessary at this point.
The short-term overheating and the headlong gains in earlier-stage concept stocks did little to change the equation for the prevailing megacap winners — copious free cash flow yields in a yield-starved and growth-challenged world.
But the hinky options-driven action, erratic speculative flows and stress on Wall Street’s index-investing and market-making machinery add a wilder element to what otherwise could be viewed as a routine correction in a powerful uptrend.Tesla, at $390 billion in market cap, would likely have placed 14th in the S&P, between Mastercard and United Healthcare. (S&P uses “float-adjusted” weighting, reflecting only publicly tradable shares, so Elon Musk’s 20% Tesla stake would not be accounted for in its index weighting).
Adding to Tesla’s market cap, those of Shopify
(likely ineligible as a Canadian company) and Zoom Video
 leaves more than $600 billion outside the benchmark, an amount that exceeds the market value of Berkshire Hathaway
. Combine with non-U.S.-domiciled winners Spotify
and Lululemon
and this cluster approaches Facebook
’s market cap.
There is some history to S&P maneuvering to make room for a bulge in newly created value outside the S&P. In 2002, the index keeper ejected non-U.S. listings (including at the time Unilever, Royal Dutch and Inco). It was viewed at the time, as a way to accommodate a group of large relatively newly public companies including Goldman Sachs, Prudential and United Parcel Service. So the dog has been wagged before.
Still, right now we also have the Dow Industrials
adding Salesforce.com
to pad its tech weighting after an Apple stock split. Online brokers experiencing network slowdowns reportedly due to the Apple and Tesla share splits last week. And an entire market fixated on the relentless buying of call options in tech, spilling into urgent hedging that has exacerbated index moves. And then Friday’s revelation of SoftBank as one of those buyers of huge quantities of upside tech exposure generated new issues about whether market infrastructure can handle a rush of speculative capital mostly rushing in one direction.Yet S&P Dow Jones senior analyst Howard Silverblatt has recently noted the closest precedent for a potential Tesla index inclusion was the November 1999 addition of Yahoo — then a runaway high-flyer of the initial internet boom, which soared 64% between its induction announcement and placement into the index.
It was part of the final blow-off top of the tech bubble, having come the same month Dow Jones capitulated to the tech dominance by adding Microsoft and Intel to the Dow Jones Industrial Average — its first-ever Nasdaq-listed members.
Tesla in many respects is its own phenomenon, given the velocity of the stock’s gains, avidity of its shareholder fan base and a valuation that is implicitly granting the company credit for many years’ worth of industry-transforming success.
Yet having to wonder about how its membership would unsettle an index that has become the single most popular means for investors to gain core exposure to U.S. stocks says plenty about the mechanics of today’s market. The common thought was that Tesla would issue shares in conjunction with joining the S&P 500 to make it easier for index funds to build the needed positions (something Facebook did as well).
 The stock’s reaction last week to a $5 billion equity-sale arrangement — falling 17% from its Aug. 31 high after moving to offer just over 1% of its market capitalization at the time — might support the idea that index funds would be forced to buy the stock at a stretched and fragile price. 
This leaves quite a bit of market value building up outside the S&P — which like many traditional investors has been hesitant to invite some of the biggest winners of today’s growth-stock love fest into their portfolios.Most investors can relate to the dilemma faced by the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee as it bypassed Tesla
for inclusion in the S&P 500 last week.
Tesla share prices had more than quadrupled this year, racing above a $450 billion market value to surpass all but a dozen S&P 500 stocks in size and consuming far more than its share of the market’s oxygen.
The committee, like investors everywhere, had to decide whether to defer to the market’s stampede into a select handful of stocks viewed as the owners of tomorrow’s digital economy or wait to see if the fever breaks to make a more considered call on whether they merit the hype.
The decision also highlights the ways a new jolt of aggressive trading by retail players and trend-chasing institutions tests today’s market structure and the vehicles used to access equity markets.
The S&P 500
is built to reflect the largest U.S. companies, and this would be the biggest ever outside the index, its urgent investors implicitly demanding entry.
Yet the gains in Tesla were so extreme, the buying so fevered, the share-price action so disorderly, it would mean forcing the index funds wielding several trillion dollars in assets to grab for the hottest of hot-potato stocks.
Meantime, Tesla’s four-quarter streak of positive earnings — a prerequisite for S&P 500 induction — was arguably tenuous and perhaps a bit forced. Its sale of pollution credits accounts for its margin of profitability, aided by curtailed capital spending.
While its index inclusion came to be seen as a forgone conclusion — and, ultimately, it might be inevitable — this was always an overhyped element of the bull case for the stock, as I detailed back in July.
Tesla shares cratered 15% in premarket trading Tuesday, the first trading day since the S&P snub.

"Nasdaq 100 is flashing a signal that suggests a looming pullback, chart analyst says",EDT-20207:31-AM,"A rush of tech earnings this week has placed the Nasdaq 100 at a critical crossroads.
The QQQ ETF
, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, will see nearly one-quarter of its components report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, alone – Microsoft
and Facebook
were among those that released results Wednesday, and Amazon
and Apple
are set to report Thursday afternoon.
The Nasdaq 100 has held up better than the broader market — the QQQ ETF has risen 3% in 2020 compared with a 9% drop for the S&P 500
.
Recent moves could foreshadow a change in fortune, though, Miller Tabak chief market strategist Matt Maley said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” 
“Just recently the QQQ saw what’s called an outside-down day, and that’s when you get a higher high than the previous day’s high, a lower low than the previous day’s low, and a close below the previous day’s low,” he said Wednesday. “That may seem like something that may happen often but actually it doesn’t and it usually shows a sign of exhaustion.”
He also said it suggests that buyers have been tapped out and a short-term pullback of at least 3% or 4% could be on the horizon.  
“That doesn’t mean that the group is topped out for a long-term disaster, but it does tell me that I think that investors don’t want to chase these stocks up here and [investors should] let them come back down from their overbought technical position and come to you,” said Maley.
Amazon, Apple and some other top stocks in the Nasdaq are in good shape for the long term even if they see a short-term pullback on earnings, says Michael Bapis, managing director at Vios Advisors at Rockefeller Capital Management.

"Stocks rise for a fifth straight day led by tech, Nasdaq closes above 11,000 for the first time",EDT-20204:22-PM,"“The overall tone of the jobless claims data is the best it has been in 3 weeks or so,” said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies, in a note. “The decline is the biggest since the week of June 6, so the data does not have the same sort of ‘stalling out’ theme that we have seen in recent weeks.”
“However, one cannot help but notice the date of the reference week, August 1, which is the day after the $600 per week enhanced benefit provided by the CARES Act expired,” Simons said. “So, is the drop this week related to an improvement in the labor market? Or is it related to folks who had some agency in their employment situation electing to collect the benefit rather than return to work now no longer being able to do so?”
The data came a day before the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show jobs growth of 1.264 million for July.The Labor Department said initial jobless claims for the week ending Aug. 1 totaled 1.186 million. That’s well below a Dow Jones estimate of 1.423 million and the lowest claims level since the pandemic began. Stocks rose on Thursday, led by tech shares, as traders kept an eye on Washington for clues on a new coronavirus stimulus package and pored over better-than-expected unemployment data. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 185.46 points higher, or 0.7%, at 27,386.98. The S&P 500 climbed 0.6% to 3,349.16 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1% to 11,108.07. Thursday marked the Nasdaq’s first close above 11,000 and the index’s seventh straight gain. Both the Dow and S&P 500 posted five-day winning streaks. The S&P 500 also closed just 1.3% below its Feb. 19 record. 
Facebook jumped more than 6% and Apple shares climbed 3.5%. Netflix advanced 1.4%. Amazon and Microsoft rose 0.6% and 1.6%, respectively. These stocks have contributed a massive share of the broader market’s gains off the March 23 low and are all handily outperforming the S&P 500. 
“It’s a tale of a bifurcated market,” said Dryden Pence, chief investment officer at Pence Wealth Management. “You’ve got a few sectors that are doing well ... and they’ve left a lot of the rest of the market behind.”
Pence said the market is “a bit ahead of itself,” but noted he would use a pull as a buying opportunity. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” that lawmakers were still at odds over how much stimulus is appropriate. He added that a bill passing the Senate would require liability protections for companies impacted by the pandemic. 
In another interview with CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street,” however, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a shot at Republicans and their priorities. She stated: “Perhaps you mistook [Republicans] for somebody who gives a damn.” Pelosi added, though, both sides will find a solution to the situation.

Lee explains Tesla is 0.7% of the Russell 1000, but it accounts for 15% of its gains year-to-date — equal to about 21 times above its weight. That makes Tesla’s contribution to the Russell 1000 so far this year as large as Amazon
’s which has a market cap five times that of the carmaker, he says. But he does agree that some of the surge is coming from short covering. Tesla is the third largest contributor of return in the Russell 1000 Index so far this year, after Microsoft and Amazon. They are weighted at 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively. “Many of our clients are benchmarked to this index, and given Tesla’s relatively high valuation, was less likely to be in a client’s portfolio.

Friedman said that decisions on returning employees to those locations, including in New York City, will be dependent on the curve of the virus in each specific place. “There will be some locations that will be open sooner than others.”
The first criteria in sending workers back will be whether the number of new Covid-19 cases is on the decline, Friedman said, adding Nasdaq will also evaluate whether local hospitals are “able to manage through the case load they have.”
In the absence of a treatment or vaccine for the coronavirus, testing and contact tracing in the broader society will be important in determining when it’s safe for workers to return to the office, Friedman said. 
“I would say that we are really at war against an invisible enemy right now and testing and contact tracing are [also] going to be critical components to be able to bring the enemy into the light so that we can then know how to manage our people safely,” she added.
Friedman’s comments come as some states are getting ready to relax their coronavirus mitigation measures in hopes of reopening their economies. Many health experts and business leaders are warning that such moves may be premature in the absence of widespread testing.
U.S. cases topped 825,000 with over 45,000 deaths as global infections approached 2.6 million with more than 178,000 fatalities, according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Wednesday morning.Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said Wednesday that taking employees’ temperatures will probably be part of their coronavirus plan to return workers to company offices around the world.

Ex-Nasdaq CEO Greifeld warns that recent IPOs’ unclear path to profits reminds him of tech bubble,EDT-201911:01-AM,"Companies going public this year will likely produce the lowest profits of any year since the dot-com bubble, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs
last month. Just 24% of 2019 IPOs will report positive net income this year. In 1999, a year before the internet bubble burst, 28% of IPOs reported positive net income in their first years as public companies. That fell to 21% for companies going public in 2000.
“If you can show profitability, you’ll be fine” in the current investing environment, Greifeld said. However, he stressed, “At the end of the day, you’ve got to take away the hype.”Former Nasdaq
CEO Bob Greifeld warned on Monday that this year’s IPO boom feels similar to the late 1990s dot-com bubble.
“It’s important to recognize that the IPO market was getting quite bubbly [nowadays],” said Greifeld, a CNBC contributor and author of the new book, “Market Mover: Lessons from a Decade of Chance at Nasdaq.”

Many companies with billion-dollar valuations at the time of their initial public offerings this year got cool receptions on Wall Street. Shares of Lyft
, Uber
and Peloton
are all among the worst performers since their market debuts.
“In a sense, it reminded me back of the dot-com era, when you had companies going public that had no known path to profitability,” said Greifeld, chairman of high-speed computerized trading firm, Virtu Financial.
During the 1990s dot-com bubble, highly speculative internet stocks were the hottest assets on Wall Street, pushing the tech-dominated Nasdaq
up more than 500% from 1995 until the bubble burst in March 2000. The Nasdaq crashed nearly 80% from 5,048.62 before bottoming in October 2002. It took 15 years for the Nasdaq to close above its prebubble record high. Since April 2015, the Nasdaq gained nearly 60% as of Friday’s close, which was about 4% from July’s all-time closing high.
In a CNBC “Squawk Box” interview Monday, Greifeld referenced the WeWork IPO, which was pulled last week after a summer of volatile headlines about slashed valuations, confusing corporate governance, and a more than $900 million loss for the first six months of 2019.
“That to me was in some ways a parody of some of the hubris you see in the start-ups,” he said.
However, Greifeld said the current IPO market is “alive is well,” despite some of this year’s bombs.
“We shouldn’t be sounding great alarm bells,” he said, but added, “post-WeWork, if you don’t have a path to profitability, you’re going to need that.”Former Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld warns that this year’s IPO boom feels similar to the late 1990s tech bubble.

’s stock still looks expensive even to traditional value investors looking for a bargain deal. J.P. Morgan’s Tusa argued that while a chart may reveal a steep 41% slide in GE stock over the last three months, the equity isn’t cheap if you consider that free cash flow is down more than 100% and debt levels have increased. ”’20/‘21 may ultimately be the period of the most significant underperformance based on expectations at the end of ’18 versus what they are now, and even what will ultimately play out versus where they were as recently as March 4, 2020,” he wrote. “For such a poor performing stock, [which] GE has historically been, and remains, the most expensive value trap we’ve seen.” — FranckThe global economy will this year likely suffer the worst economic pullback since the Great Depression, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, as governments worldwide grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic.

By contrast, in January it had forecast a global GDP (gross domestic product) expansion of 3.3% for this year. “It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, said in the latest World Economic Outlook report. — AmaroJPMorgan posted first-quarter profit well below analysts’ expectations, although the bank’s revenue held up amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bank on Tuesday posted quarterly per share earnings of 78 cents, missing analysts’ $1.84 estimate. The earnings drop was caused by a massive $6.8 billion addition to the bank’s credit reserves. The move signals that management expects a surge in defaults across the company’s lending businesses, from credit cards in its consumer division to energy, real estate and retail sector loans in its commercial operations. Profit of $2.87 billion plunged 69% from a year earlier, driven mostly by the provisions, while revenue proved to be more resilient, slipping 3% from a year earlier to $29.07 billion.

Still, the stock rose more than 1% in the premarket as net interest income came in above expectations. —ImbertJPMorgan is building its credit reserves in anticipation that people might not be able to pay their bills, especially for credit cards. The bank’s first quarter earnings statement showed its credit reserves increased by $6.8 billion from the prior year, 56% of which was set aside for its consumer card division. “In the first quarter, the underlying results of the company were extremely good, however given the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves of $6.8B, resulting in total credit costs of $8.3B for the quarter,” CEO Jamie Dimon said in the earnings release. Of the $6.8 billion, more than half — or $3.8 billion — is earmarked for the bank’s Card division. In total $4.4 billion is allocated for consumer finance, with the remaining $2.4 billion for the bank’s wholesale business. – StevensThe global economic hit likely will be rate four times worse than the financial crisis and the U.S. will see its highest unemployment rate since World War II, according to a Goldman Sachs forecast. With most of the world’s developing economies on a near total shutdown to try to stop the coronavirus spread, Goldman sees a second quarter GDP decline of 11% from a year ago and 35% from the previous quarter on an annualized basis. In the U.S., the headline unemployment rate should hit 15% “and even this understates the severity of the situation” as many workers will be sidelined and not looking for jobs amid an anticipated reopening of the economy. That will accompany a GDP decline in the U.S. of 11% from a year ago and 34% on a quarterly basis, both numbers also considerably worse than anything seen during the financial crisis in 2008. — CoxJohnson & Johnson stock rallied 3.5% in premarket trading after the drugmaker announced in its first-quarter earnings report that it’s raising its dividend.

On Tuesday the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates oil and gas production in the state, held a hearing to discuss potential output cuts.

"Nasdaq jumps more than 2% led by Amazon, S&P 500 goes positive for 2020",EDT-20204:23-PM,"Dow member Pfizer and BioNTech reported early positive data on a joint coronavirus vaccine candidate, saying the drug “elicited high, dose level-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing titers and RBD-binding IgG concentrations after the second dose.” Pfizer shares rose 0.6% on the news while BioNTech traded 3.4% higher.
Another vaccine candidate from Oxford University and AstraZeneca showed a positive immune response in an early trial. 
These announcements came after British pharmaceutical company Synairgen
claimed that its new respiratory coronavirus treatment has reduced the number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients needing intensive care in a clinical trial. Its shares rose more than 350% on the European market.
Coronavirus cases have been rising at an alarming rate and now total more than 3.7 million in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. 
Traders also turned their eyes to Washington as lawmakers begin negotiations on new stimulus measures.
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a stimulus package worth roughly $2 trillion which expanded unemployment benefits for those laid off during the pandemic. Among these expanded benefits, a $600-a-week check was included. However, these extra payments are set to expire later this month.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about the size and shape of the next bill, particularly on the consumer side,” said Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies, in a note.
“We believe consensus expects a roughly $1-$1.5[T] package, so if the draft comes in on the high-end of that range, it would be seen as a positive surprise,” Markowska added. “In light of the deteriorating growth momentum, it is highly unlikely that Republicans under-deliver, which means that risks are skewed to the high side.”

Amazon rose 7.9% to post its best day since December 2018 after a Goldman Sachs analyst hiked his price target on the stock to $3,800 per share, the highest on the Street. Facebook and Netflix gained more than 1% each, while  Apple and Alphabet gained 2.1% and 3.1%, respectively. Shares of Microsoft jumped 4.3%.
Monday’s strong gain in tech shares came after the Nasdaq’s first negative week in three, while beaten-down value names outperformed in that time period. 
“If we lose [technology’s] leadership in a meaningful way, I think it will adversely affect the overall market,” said Douglas Busch, founder of ChartSmarter, in a note. “If the sector can just take a rest, and keep in the middle of the pack akin to a smart jockey that has a lot of horse under him in a thoroughbred race, then it will likely see a surge again into the fall.”"
"Trump’s climate inaction has left companies stepping up to fill the gap, Nasdaq CEO says",EST-20203:19-AM,"Friedman said that Nasdaq has been upping its game in making the capital markets business greener, with the introduction of new securities, like green bonds and funds focused on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). Nordic stock markets like Sweden and Finland’s have been leading the way on those initiatives, she said.
“We own all the markets in the Nordic countries, and the Nordics are leading the world in terms of issues of climate change,” said Friedman. “We’re bringing that DNA into our American business as well.”
Nasdaq operates the Nasdaq stock market in New York as well as eight European exchanges, including Copenhagen, Helsinki and Stockholm.Climate has been front and center at 2020′s edition of Davos, an event in the Swiss Alps that hosts some of the world’s best-known world leaders and billionaires. It’s being attended this year by Greta Thunberg, the teen environmental activist that found herself in a war of words with the U.S. president last year.
Thunberg on Tuesday warned that the remaining carbon budget would be “gone in less than eight years” at current emission levels. “These aren’t anyone’s views. This is the science.”President Donald Trump’s lack of engagement on the issue of climate change has meant companies will need to step up their environmental efforts instead, according to the CEO of Nasdaq
.
“I actually believe that because of the fact that the government hasn’t been engaged on this topic, the corporate world has realized we need to take a much bigger role,” Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman said in a fireside chat with CNBC’s Karen Tso at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
Friedman said that Trump’s inaction on climate was “not necessarily a good thing” and has left a “hole” that the corporate sector has found a way to fill in. She said she still thinks it would be better “if the whole ecosystem is engaged and aligned.”
The U.S. was widely panned by the international community when it decided to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aimed to reduce carbon emissions significantly, thereby decreasing the impacts of climate change. The architect of the agreement, Christiana Figueres, on Monday blasted Trump over the decision, asking: “How can he face himself?”Nasdaq’s CEO said U.S. inaction on climate change is “not necessarily a good thing” and has left a “hole” for companies to fill in.
The topic of climate has been front and center at Davos, with teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg among the list of attendees.

"Dow jumps 360 points on virus treatment hope, Netflix leads Nasdaq to another record",EDT-20204:45-PM,"JPMorgan was the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, jumping 5.4%. Dow-component Goldman Sachs rose 4.4%. Meanwhile, Citigroup and Wells Fargo rallied 6.4% and 5.9%, respectively. Big banks are set to kick off earnings season next week. 
“On days in which there’s promise of health solution, or that the economy might actually recover faster than expected, you tend to get all your cyclical stocks ... leading the charge,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. Conversely, “when it looks like the economy is going to stall, or the recovery will be slower than expected, investors tend to go back to the old growth stalwarts of technology.”
Friday’s gains put the Dow up 0.9% for the week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.7% and 4% in that time period. For the year, the Dow and the S&P 500 are down 8.6% and 1.4%, respectively, while the Nasdaq is up more than 18%.
To be sure, some investors remain concerned as new coronavirus cases continue to pile up. The U.S. reported Thursday more than 63,000 additional coronavirus cases, a record. The country’s seven-day average now stands at more than 53,000 cases.
“For the US, the outlook is bleak – the COVID crisis continues to metastasize as transmissions stay elevated while hospitalizations and fatalities rise too,” said Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge, in a note. “While US bulls hang on to ‘Amazon, a vaccine, and the Fed’ and those three items will prevent a steep decline, it’s very hard to look at the SPX and find it near-term compelling.”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 369.21 points higher, or 1.4%, to 26,075.30. The S&P 500 climbed 1%, or 32.99 points, to 3,185.04. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6%, or 69.69 points, to another record closing high of 10,617.44, lifted by Amazon and Netflix. 
Gilead Sciences said its coronavirus treatment candidate, remdesivir, showed an improvement in clinical recovery and a 62% reduction in the risk of mortality compared with standard care.

Nasdaq: The pipeline for Chinese companies listing in the US is ‘stronger than it’s ever been’,EDT-201910:49-PM,"However, McCooey says such pressure presents more of an opportunity than a challenge for the Nasdaq.
“We would welcome opportunities to talk to different exchanges that are growing and might compete with us on the listing side but give us opportunity on the trading side and the regulatory side to be their partners,” he told CNBC, noting that Nasdaq is a technology partner for many exchanges.
Despite the challenges from the likes of Shanghai’s new board, McCooey said he’s still optimistic about Chinese companies continuing to look for American listings.
“As I travel from ... Beijing to Shanghai to Hangzhou to Shenzhen, and I hear the stories of these entrepreneurs and see the businesses that they’re growing, I am more encouraged by what is being built in China and what is happening in China than I ever have been,” said McCooey.
“I think the pipeline for IPOs to the U.S. remains as strong, it’s even stronger than it’s ever been,” he added.Expected to kick off trading as early as June, the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Science and Technology Innovation Board, frequently deemed China’s Nasdaq, was first announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in November last year. It’s an effort to keep the country’s tech superstars at home and strengthen the capacity of Chinese financial services to serve tech innovation.
The new board’s rules, reportedly based on exchanges in the U.S. and Hong Kong, will waive some of China’s previous restrictions, such as valuation caps and a ban on unprofitable firms, which made some big names choose overseas venues for listing.
For the Nasdaq, pressure might start to take a toll as Shanghai’s new tech board has already shown some early signs of success by receiving 100 IPO applications from Chinese companies as of May 6. Those companies are aiming to raise 98.39 billion yuan ($14.55 billion) in total, according to China’s official Xinhua News Agency.However, there’s some concern that multiple factors could make it more difficult for Nasdaq to win future deals coming from the world’s second-biggest economy. Those worries include uncertainty about the future strength of the U.S. stock markets, the strong performance of Chinese exchanges (despite a dip earlier this week), and a new technology-focused board in Shanghai.Nasdaq is expecting more Chinese companies to squeeze their listings into this year’s already-crowded U.S. IPO scene, trying to take advantage of the longest bull market in American history.
“In general, the markets feel very, very strong,” McCooey told CNBC. “The fundamentals are there. The most recent earnings reports by companies indicate that the fundamentals are strong within the market, so I don’t think that investors should worry too much — although they should always be diligent.”“Last year was very much capital intensive,” said McCooey. “I think that the capital raised may not be as strong this year, but the number of companies coming to market in the U.S. from China will be equally if not more than last year. ”
Another notable name is Luckin Coffee, a competitor to Starbucks in China. The Beijing-based coffee chain is reportedly seeking to raise between $500 million and $800 million with a valuation between $4 billion and $5 billion, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Chinese live streaming platform Douyu is also planning to raise $500 million on the New York Stock Exchange.This year so far, some of the biggest Chinese tech start-ups, such as Didi Chuxing, Ant Financial and ByteDance, have remained quiet. However, less capital sought by lesser-known names does not necessarily mean that 2019 will be a weaker year for China’s tech IPOs on the Nasdaq, according to McCooey.The U.S. has seen several big-name companies go public this year — such as Lyft
, Pinterest
and Dropbox
— and Wall Street is getting ready for Uber, which is seeking to raise $9 billion. Meanwhile, Chinese privately held start-ups coming to the U.S., unlike last year, are relatively lesser-known and tend to choose downsized listings.
In 2018, iQiyi, China’s most popular Netflix-like streaming service, raised $2.4 billion; Pinduoduo, a Chinese online group discounter, raised $1.6 billion; Shanghai-based NIO
, an electric vehicle maker, raised $1.15 billion; and music streaming platform Tencent Music
raked in nearly $1.1 billion.Nasdaq
is looking to benefit from a strong year for Chinese tech companies launching initial public offerings.
Last week, two Chinese companies debuted on the tech-heavy U.S. exchange, and several more are set to join the IPO wave soon. Chinese social commerce company Yunji closed 29% higher than its listing price on Friday, raising $121 million, and So-Young, a Beijing-based online marketplace for plastic surgery services, raised $179.4 million. The latter soared 31.88% on its IPO day and surged another 14% on Friday.
“It seems like we will have over 40 IPOs from China, [which] are coming to the U.S. this year. So [2019] could be the strongest year ever,” said Bob McCooey, chairman of Nasdaq Asia-Pacific.
Other notable names, including Futu and Up Fintech, join Yunji and So-Young to amount to 12 Asia-Pacific companies that have listed on the Nasdaq so far this year. In total, those firms have raised $777 million at their debuts — that compares to the $9.6 billion raised by a total of 53 global IPOs on the Nasdaq as of May 3.There have been 12 Asia-Pacific companies that have listed on the Nasdaq so far this year, raising a total of $777 million at their debuts.

"S&P 500 ends day 0.7% lower, Nasdaq sheds nearly 2% for worst day since March",EDT-20214:09-PM,"The S&P 500 fell on Tuesday amid selling in Big Tech and other high-growth stocks, erasing the benchmark’s strong start to the month.
The broad market index closed the session 0.7% lower at 4,164.66 after dropping 1.5% at its low. Pressure on some of the globe’s largest technology companies sent the Nasdaq Composite down 1.9% to 13,633.50 for its worst day since March.
Apple, the largest publicly traded company in the U.S., fell 3.5%. Google-parent Alphabet lost 1.6%, Facebook shed 1.3% and electric car maker Tesla dropped 1.7%. Investors did not spare the market’s chipmakers, with Nvidia and Intel losing 3.3% and 0.6%, respectively.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day in the green thanks to strong performance in Dow Inc and Caterpillar. The 30-stock benchmark closed 19.8 points, or 0.1%, higher to 34,133.03 after dropping more than 300 points at one point Tuesday.
Reasons for the downward pressure varied, but strategists cited a mix of concerns about rising inflation, fears the Federal Reserve may have to taper monetary stimulus earlier than telegraphed, and the potential for tax increases in the months ahead.
U.S. equities hit their lows of the day following Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments that interest rates may have to rise somewhat to keep economy from overheating.
Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere wrote that while Tuesday’s modest move in rates may not be a loud siren that investors are worried about the Fed, he nonetheless believes taper fears are playing a role.
“Best we can tell supply concerns are a major issue for investors and inflation / inflation expectations are becoming a headwind,” he wrote in an email. “Although Fed futures are pricing in a much faster pace of rate hikes vs what the Fed wants...that is not the story today. The story is inflation and stronger growth numbers leading to even more inflation given supply constraints and what that means for equities.”
DeBusschere’s supply-side concerns join those of a growing number of executives and investors who say rising input prices are starting to erode profit margins.
Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said during his company’s annual meeting over the weekend that he is seeing “very substantial inflation” and his companies are raising prices.
Other companies, such as Clorox, have said in recent earnings reports that the prices they pay for the materials used to make their products are rising and could ultimately be passed on to customers. Commodity prices, from lumber to corn to palladium, have surged in recent months.
Others have said that even blowout earnings results have been unable to quell marketplace jitters. Even accounting for Tuesday’s losses, the S&P 500 is still up more than 10% so far this year.
“We have gone through a two to three week period that has seen really good news get little or no reaction in markets,” wrote Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Investors get uneasy at new highs, and there have been 25 new highs for the S&P 500 so far this year.”
“There are concerns that the roaring 20′s economic explosion will take longer than just this summer as people slowly get comfortable getting out and about,” he added. “Equities look expensive on a trailing basis, but not from a forward looking viewpoint.”
With the market at all-time highs, investors are torn between playing the reopening with shares like retailers or continuing to bet on Big Tech, which just reported blockbuster earnings.
The move in equities followed solid gains for the Dow on Monday as investors piled into shares that would benefit the most from an economic reopening. The 30-stock benchmark rallied more than 200 points, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.3%. Retail stocks led the market advance on Monday with Gap and Macy’s rallying more than 7%.
Pfizer
shares rose slightly following quarterly results that beat expectations and raising its 2021 guidance. CVS Health
shares jumped 4.4% after the pharmacy chain and insurance company also raised its guidance.
United States Steel
popped 7.9% after Credit Suisse upgraded the stock to outperform from underperform, saying that the surge in prices for steel made it clear that the industry was in a “super cycle.” 
“Investors could be getting increasingly disappointed that stocks are not doing well in the face of fantastic earnings news,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, told CNBC.

Correction: Due to an editing error, this story was updated to reflect the correct spelling of Martha MacCallum’s name.Tuesday’s gains came after a volatile overnight session amid comments from White House trade advisor Peter Navarro. Dow futures had dropped about 400 points overnight after Navarro’s Monday interview on Fox News’ “The Story.”
Fox’s Martha MacCallum asked, “Do you think that the president sort of ... I mean, he obviously really wanted to hang onto this trade deal as much as possible. And he wanted them to make good on the promises because there had been progress made on that trade deal, but given everything that’s happened and all the things you just listed, is that over?”
“It’s over. Yes,” Navarro responded.
In his subsequent statement, Navarro said, “I was simply speaking to the lack of trust we now have of the Chinese Communist Party after they lied about the origins of the China virus and foisted a pandemic upon the world.”
“My comments have been taken wildly out of context,” Navarro added. “They had nothing at all to do with the Phase I trade deal, which continues in place.” This clarification sent stock futures back higher. 
In his interview with Fox, Navarro said “the turning point” came when the U.S. heard about the coronavirus outbreak in China. Navarro insisted that the administration only heard about the virus after the trade deal between Washington and Beijing was signed on Jan. 15.
President Donald Trump also tweeted that the existing trade deal remains in place.
Stocks were coming off solid gains as shares of major tech companies led the major averages higher on Monday. Those gains came despite a rising number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. 
“The message today may be that the virus and the bull market can coexist,” Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, told CNBC. “Despite back to back days of Covid19 cases above 30,000 over the weekend and ongoing reports of hot spots, the stock market managed to post a strong gain.  Market action seems to suggest that investors expect the economy to continue improving in the months ahead even though the country is likely to experience spotty or temporary spikes in the virus.”The Nasdaq Composite
rose to a fresh record on Tuesday with Apple leading major tech names higher as investors cheered a slew of announcements from the tech giant’s WorldWide Developers Conference. 
The tech-heavy index closed 0.7% higher at 10,131.37, notching its eighth straight daily gain. That marks the Nasdaq’s longest winning streak since December, when it advanced for 11 straight sessions. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed 131.14 points, or 0.5%, to close at 26,156.10. The S&P 500
ended the session up 0.4% at 3,131.29.
Apple rose 2.1% and reached an all-time high. On Monday, the company unveiled new operating systems for its iPhones and computers. Apple also said it would use its own chips when building new Mac computers, ditching Intel’s in the process.
UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said the transition away from Intel chips is a “continuation of its strategy of vertical integration following years of convergence” in its mobile and Mac products. Arcuri hiked his price target on the stock to $400 per share from $325 per share. The new price target implies an 11% upside from Monday’s close of $358.87.
Other tech-related names also lifted the broader market. Facebook advanced 1.3%. Amazon hit an all-time high, closing 1.9% higher. Bank stocks rose broadly. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all climbed at least 0.7%. 
The rally put the S&P 500 up more than 42% from its March 23 intraday low. The broad-market index is also down just 3.1% year to date. 
“It feels in some ways the markets have a case of revenge spending,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners. “It feels like people have been cooped up and they’re buying everything the can.”
“There’s a positive bias here, and investors are just running with it,” Bailey said. "

Americans who qualify for state unemployment benefits have also received an additional $600 a week since Congress passed the $2.2 trillion CARES Act in March.

While the group did not extend the record cut into August, the meeting revealed a high level of compliance with current quotas, and pledges from companies that have over-produced, including Iraq, to curtail production. “An 87% compliance on the OPEC+ agreed production cuts is a good percentage,” said Bjornar Tonhaugen, global head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. “In fact a better percentage than most market participants really expected when the curtailments were first announced. The high-level compliance is a song to traders’ ears who have been worried that words may have been too good to be true,” he added. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, settled 88 cents, or 2.32%, higher at $38.84 per barrel. International benchmark Brent crude finished the session 1.97%, or 80 cents, higher at $41.51 per barrel. –StevensWillie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird, said the recent retail sales surge shows the economy is “getting back up to speed,”  but added more improvements are needed before sounding the all-clear. “When stuck in traffic, lurching forward from a dead stop is encouraging, but a far cry from getting back to cruising speed. After an initial bounce, broad and steady progress would be evidence that recovery is not just a false start,” he said. —ImbertWith roughly one hour left in the trading session, the Nasdaq Composite was on pace to post its fifth consecutive gain as Amazon shares rose slightly.

"Dow falls more than 30 points, but Nasdaq ekes out fifth straight gain",EDT-20206:09-PM,"The major averages head into Friday’s session with solid weekly gains. The Dow was up 1.9% through Thursday’s close for the week while the S&P 500 has gained 2.4% in that time period. The Nasdaq has jumped more than 3% week to date. 
“The fears regarding infection rates following the reopening of various States within the US and in other countries are understandable,” said Michael Shaoul, chairman and CEO of Marketfield Asset Management, in a note. “We do not doubt that progress will have a staccato feel to it in many localities, but we would be very surprised if another outbreak took hold that came anywhere close to what we saw take place at the start of 2020.”

Several states in the U.S. are experiencing a resurgence of infections. Arizona reported a record-high number of new confirmed cases, while Texas saw an 11% daily spike in hospitalizations for patients with Covid-19 on Wednesday. California, meanwhile, reported its largest-ever daily increase of coronavirus cases. 
In China, the country’s capital city has reportedly closed schools and canceled flights to contain the latest wave of coronavirus cases. However, a disease expert in China announced the latest outbreak of coronavirus cases in Beijing had been brought under control. 
“We believe the market is pricing in quite a bit of good news and the rally is likely to take a breather in coming months as the recovery evolves,” Scott Wren, Wells Fargo’s senior global market strategist, said in a note. “We expect volatility in the coming months as we gauge how the reopenings are going and how consumer spending is progressing.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell for a second straight day on Thursday as investors weighed the rising number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. and around the world along with disappointing unemployment data.
The 30-stock Dow closed 39.51 points lower, or 0.2%, at 26,080.10. The Nasdaq Composite
, meanwhile, climbed 0.3% to 9,943.05 for its fifth consecutive gain. The S&P 500
ended the session up 0.1% at 3,115.34.
Stocks struggled for direction throughout the session. At one point, the Dow was down 271 points and briefly turned positive. The S&P 500 also alternated between gains and losses for most of the day. 
“Going forward, at these heightened levels, it’s going to be much more difficult to get another significant leg higher unless forward-looking fundamentals get better,” said Megan Horneman, director of portfolio strategy at Verdence Capital Advisors, noting the market has already experienced sharp gains in a very short amount of time. “The earnings environment needs to meet that euphoria we’ve seen in the run-up after that bear market.”
Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all closed slightly higher to lift the Nasdaq. Declines in Carnival and American Airlines kept a lid on the S&P 500′s gains. 
Initial U.S. weekly jobless claims rose more than expected last week, coming in at 1.508 million. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a print of 1.3 million. "
"One stock that drove the Nasdaq to above 10,000 is still a buy, traders say",EDT-20207:16-AM,"“But on a longer-term basis, first of all, it had been in a sideways range for about 18 months, and in April, it broke above that range,” Maley said. “That was very, very bullish. Then in late May or very early this month, it got stuck in another sideways range and has now broken above that.”
Now, with commercial real estate facing problems as businesses large and small run the risk of going under, Amazon could have a built-in bull case on its hands, Maley said.
As the demand for last-mile delivery grows, “that’s where they lose a lot of money, a lot of their margin,” Maley said. “That is going to change.”
“They’re going to get commercial real estate, even in small towns, at a cheap price. People are going to go to those places that are still very convenient and buy and pick up their stuff. If they want it taken to their door, they’ll still be able to get it, but [Amazon] is going to charge them for that,” he said. “So, you’re going to have this big pickup in volume that they’ve gotten recently, … but they’re not going to have the costs associated with it. They’re actually going to pick up margin. So, both on a fundamental and a technical basis, I think on a long-term basis, Amazon’s the best choice.”
Both traders also flagged the stocks they wouldn’t buy in this group. For Tepper, that was Zoom Video, which struggled to see upside in an increasingly crowded marketplace. For Maley, it was the far-too-overbought stock eBay.

DisclaimerThe Nasdaq Composite
may have just closed above 10,000 for the first time, but traders say one of its top performers can keep rallying.
It hit the milestone on Wednesday, but was down to 9,957 in Thursday’s premarket. Since Dec. 26, when the index first closed above 9,000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100
has been a huge contributor to its move higher.
Zoom Video
, Tesla
, Regeneron
, Nvidia
, Amazon
and eBay
are among the 10 best-performing Nasdaq 100 stocks since the day after Christmas.
Of these names, Amazon is still the best choice despite its hefty price tag, said traders Mark Tepper of Strategic Wealth Partners and Miller Tabak’s Matt Maley.
“Amazon’s the best play right here,” Tepper told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Wednesday. The stock closed up nearly 2% at $2,647.45 on Wednesday after hitting a new all-time high.
“It’s the best diversified post-Covid play. They’re literally in every single business that’s going to thrive on a going-forward basis. You’ve got e-commerce, cloud, digital advertising, personal assistance,” Tepper said. “Normally, during periods of heavy investment for Amazon like they’re seeing right now, the multiple comes down, but apparently that doesn’t matter anymore when the Fed’s dishing out trillions of dollars like it’s going out of style. So, I think the best pick right here would still be Amazon.”
Maley also backed Amazon, adding that the stock tends to act in favor of the bulls from a technical standpoint.
“It’s had this huge move. It’s getting overbought. It’s due for a bit of a pullback like just about every other stock in the market right now,” Maley said in the same “Trading Nation” interview."
The tech-led Nasdaq just broke its longest-ever ‘uptrend’ in troubling sign for market,EST-20204:42-PM,"After more than 90 consecutive days with a reading over 50, on Monday the Nasdaq 100′s RSI fell to 39.3, according to FactSet.
“When similar streaks of bullish momentum ended, the Nasdaq-100 usually chopped sideways or fell over the next 3 months,” Sentimentrader said.
Some of the index’s largest decliners on Tuesday included Western Digital
, which was down more than 6%, and Micron
, which shed more than 5%. Microsoft
and Apple
— the two largest U.S.-listed companies — were each down more than 1%, and are currently trading in correction levels.
Tech stocks were instrumental in leading the market higher during the bull run, but have been hit especially hard as investors seek safety trades amid the coronavirus-induced selloff.
That said, when it comes to the Nasdaq 100, Sentimentrader noted that after the initial 3 month period of weakness, following a drop in the index’s RSI reading, “strong momentum usually beget more gains.”

“Coffee was supposed to be recession-proof business and I think they got caught off guard a little bit, which is why the innovation of the management team is so important,” Bapis said in the same “Trading Nation” interview.
“They were crushed by the pandemic, but we see opportunity here,” he said. “They’re reinventing themselves with curbside pickup and other different innovations during these slow times.”
Bapis’ other pick was the stock of networking technology company Cisco, which closed more than 1% higher on Tuesday.
“Work from home is going to drive their demand. It’s here to stay for the foreseeable future,” Bapis said, noting Cisco’s ongoing expansion of its networking and security applications. “At the end of the day, technology drives our society now, and we believe they just got hit for no reason.”
So, when it comes to Cisco and Starbucks, “I think these two companies will be higher in 12 to 18 months, especially due to strong leadership,” Bapis said.
As for the Nasdaq 100 itself, Gordon said he thinks it will soon retake its Feb. 19 record as investors rotate back into previously sidelined groups such as small caps, semiconductor stocks and the FAANG names.
“I don’t think it’s unusual ... to see a little bit of consolidation below the all-time highs as we’re getting a little bit of a pickup trade here in the other sectors that have been significantly beaten down,” Gordon said. “We’re seeing a really good sort of response here and we think what we saw pre-Covid should reemerge here going forward once all this dust settles.”

Disclaimer“It did hold up trend support in that parallel channel. The [relative strength index of momentum] got very oversold. But, again, support held and we don’t have resistance, if and when this pandemic passes, up until about [$]110,” he said.
Starbucks shares closed less than 1% lower at $77.78 on Tuesday.
Pointing to Starbucks’ daily chart, Gordon said the stock could get a “caffeine shot” of momentum that could bring it to the $100 level if it’s able to break above short-term resistance around $80.Struggling Starbucks
shares can pick up steam and catch up to the broader market, two traders said.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq eke out fresh record closing highs,EST-20204:06-PM,"Bridgewater Associates founder and billionaire investor Ray Dalio said the virus’ impact on global markets may have been exaggerated. 
“Because of the temporary nature of that, I would expect more of a rebound,” Dalio said at a conference in Abu Dhabi. “It most likely will be something that in another year or two will be well beyond what everyone will be talking about.”
However, companies such as Under Armour have noted they will take a hit from the outbreak. Under Armour warned Tuesday the outbreak could lower sales by $50 million to $60 million.
“While the stock market assumes no impact from the virus as we continue to chug higher, expect much more of this kind of talk as companies figure out the full effect,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “For many companies, these sales will not be made up.”

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee that the central bank is “closely monitoring” the coronavirus situation for a potential hit to China and the global economy. During the Q&A portion of his testimony, Powell noted it is “too early to say” how the coronavirus will ultimately impact the U.S. economy. 
“The coronavirus clearly presents a risk to the global economy,” said Danielle DiMartino Booth, CEO of Quill Intelligence. “The Chinese economy is four times greater than it was during the SARS outbreak and China has established itself as the most critical link in the global supply chain.”
Investors have been grappling with fears that of the coronavirus denting global economic growth. 
China’s National Health Commission on Monday night said the death toll had risen to 1,016 people with 42,638 confirmed cases. However, data from Johns Hopkins University showed the number of new confirmed cases was its lowest since late January, increasing optimism around the country’s efforts to contain the outbreak.
Fears over the economic fallout from the outbreak have also been offset by positive economic indicators. Jobs data released last week easily beat analyst expectations while U.S. manufacturing and services activity show signs of improvement.

"Nasdaq could snap longest win streak since dot-com bust, but that’s not a bad thing",EST-20199:07-AM,"The Nasdaq
is set to post its first negative week in 11.
The tech-heavy index is down 2 percent since Monday, coming off its longest weekly winning stretch since December 1999. That run preceded the dot-com bust just months afterward, a wave of selling that swept tech stocks from highs.
Rather than a warning sign for the Nasdaq, LPL Financial senior market strategist Ryan Detrick says history suggests this kind of winning streak is actually a bullish sign.
“If you go back in history since the Nasdaq started in the early ’70s, what we found 12 months after these long win streaks, the Nasdaq was actually higher seven out of eight times a year later. The only time it was lower was the tech bubble,” Detrick said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
In the past eight 10-week win streaks for the Nasdaq, the index was up an average 4.4 percent in the following 12 months. Stripping out the 2000 dot-com bust, the Nasdaq was up an average 10 percent in the 12 months afterward.
“Look at the , the exact same thing,” he added. “The S&P was higher seven out of eight times a year after Nasdaq strength like this. … The S&P was just above its 10-day moving average for 40 days in a row, the longest streak in nine years and again forward returns after long streaks like that, very strong also.”
In the 12 months after the last eight 10-week win streak on the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 was up an average 8.8 percent.
“These streaks that we’re talking about really do suggest to us that this bull market is alive and well and new highs in the S&P and Nasdaq in the second half of this year,” said Detrick.
The S&P 500 is still more than 6 percent off its record high set in September, while the Nasdaq is nearly 9 percent off its own all-time high reached in August.
The bull market will reach its 10-year anniversary on Saturday, the day that marked the closing low of the financial crisis. Detrick says one thing has characterized the low points.
“The hallmark we’ve seen really for the last 10 years … has been panic and fear on pullbacks,” said Detrick. “We just had a 20 percent correction. … Analysts drastically cut their earnings guidance. Our view there is once again people are panicking. The underlying fundamentals of this economy really still are strong.”
Stocks have bounced strongly off a sharp downturn late last year. Since their December lows, the S&P 500 has rallied 17 percent and the Nasdaq 20 percent."

Coinbase’s widely watched direct listing on Wednesday opened at $381 on the Nasdaq and shot up as high as $429, but shares quickly rolled over and closed at $328.28. As Coinbase shares reversed lower, bitcoin fell 1.5% to around $61,930 from a record high of more than $63,800. Crypto investors were hailing the company’s stock market debut as a major milestone for the industry after years of skepticism from Wall Street and regulators.
Tesla, a holder of bitcoin and a speculative tech play, fell nearly 4%. Netflix and Facebook dropped more than 2% each, which Amazon, Microsoft and Apple all dipped at least 1%.
Strong bank earnings helped support sentiment on Wednesday. Shares of Goldman Sachs climbed more than 2% after the bank blew past analysts’ expectations with record first-quarter net profits and revenues on strong performance from the firm’s equities trading and investment banking units.
JPMorgan Chase beat analysts’ estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by a $5.2 billion benefit from releasing money it had previously set aside for loan losses that didn’t develop. Shares of JPMorgan dipped 1.8%, however, paring its 2021 gains to 19%.
Wells Fargo
also reported earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations for its first quarter. The stock rallied 5.5%.
“The first wave of Q1 big bank results look pretty much as strong as most analysts had expected – even stronger actually,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “It’s possible that we’re in a powerful market that’s in a forgiving mood when it comes to bad news. The path of least resistance for stocks continues to seem to be to go higher, with the market climbing a wall of worries that just doesn’t go away.”
Bank stocks have risen sharply so far this year, with the S&P 500 financials sector gaining nearly 20%, easily outpacing the S&P 500. 
In other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the central bank will reduce its bond purchases likely well before it hikes interest rates.
“We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December,” Powell said to the Economic Club of Washington. “That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”
On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration called for a pause in administering J&J’s Covid-19 vaccine after six people in the U.S. developed a rare disorder involving blood clots. The announcement triggered a sell-off in reopening plays like airlines and cruise line operators.
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the drugmaker can deliver 10% more vaccine doses to the U.S. by the end of May than previously expected. Plus, Moderna said its Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective at protecting against the virus six months after a person’s second shot.

"Nasdaq-listed Chinese video platform Bilibili to do a secondary listing in Hong Kong, raise up to $1.5 billion",EDT-20201:32-AM,"Bilibili went public on the Nasdaq in 2018 at $11.50 per American depositary share (ADS), raising $483 million. On Thursday, Bilibili shares closed at $46.60 a piece. This year alone, the company’s shares have risen over 150%. 
The video platform is aimed at China’s younger generations and the company makes money in a number of ways. Mobile games is its largest revenue driver. It also hosts live broadcasts during which users can buy virtual items. Bilibili also makes money from advertising.
Second quarter revenue came in at 2.6 billion yuan ($370.5 million), a 70% year-on-year increase. Bilibili has 171.6 million average monthly active users. 
Rather than Netflix-style shows, Bilibili relies on user-generated content, similar to YouTube. 
Bilibili has been focusing on growing its user base this year by boosting its content offerings. In August, the company signed a deal with Riot Games, the owner of League of Legends, to broadcast their global events in China. GUANGZHOU, China — Chinese video platform Bilibili
is gearing up for a secondary listing in Hong Kong which could raise up to $1.5 billion, CNBC has confirmed.
Bilibili is currently listed on the Nasdaq in the U.S. The Hong Kong secondary listing is likely to happen next year, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.
The video platform, which is popular with Chinese millennials, could raise between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, the person said.
The Nikkei Asian Review first reported the news.
A spokesperson for Bilibili declined to comment when contacted by CNBC.
Bilibili’s secondary listing would make it the latest in a long line of U.S.-listed Chinese firms to raise money in Hong Kong. Alibaba
, JD.com
and NetEase
are among the high-profile names that have carried out secondary listings in Hong Kong in the past few months. 
Rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China have threatened to spill over to Chinese firms listed on Wall Street.

"S&P 500 closes at record, Nasdaq adds 1% as stocks shake off J&J vaccine halt, higher inflation",EDT-20214:32-PM,"The consumer price index, one of Wall Street’s most-popular inflation gauges, rose 0.6% in March and increased 2.6% from the same period a year ago. Economists polled by Dow Jones were projecting the headline index to rise by 0.5% month over month and 2.5% year over year.
Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.3% monthly and 1.6% year over year.
Government officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Sunday and Biden administration economists on Monday, stressed that while they expect a jump in inflation in the months ahead, the change could prove temporary due to comparisons with last year’s pandemic lockdowns and extra consumer spending from stimulus checks and pent-up demand.
Private sector strategists and economists also said that the reading may not be a true gauge of rising prices. Fed officials said they are willing to let inflation run hot for a period of time without changing their accommodative policy stance, including asset purchases and a benchmark interest near zero.
“US equities are drifting slightly higher Tuesday as investors digest a higher-than-expected inflation in the CPI report and position ahead of 1Q21 earnings, which start on Wednesday,” Chris Hussey, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note.
“Underneath the surface, the market is assuming a defensive posture today led by mega-cap Tech and the bond proxies -- Utilities and Real Estate,” he added.
The market has been calm over the past week as Wall Street settled into a lull ahead of the first-quarter earnings season. Corporate news is set to pick up later in the week, with JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Delta Air Lines among the companies set to report quarterly results.
The bond market was also subdued on Tuesday, with the 10-year Treasury yield edging lower to just above 1.62%. Yields move inversely to prices.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell 68.13 points, 0.2%, to close at 33,677.27 after dropping more than 150 points earlier in the session.
Reopening trades came under pressure Tuesday morning after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it’s recommending a pause in the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after reported cases of blood clotting.
There have been six reported cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot after receiving the J&J vaccine, the FDA said. The administration is calling for a pause in the vaccine until Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes its investigation into these cases.
“Until that process is complete, we are recommending this pause,” the FDA said. “This is important to ensure that the health care provider community is aware of the potential for these adverse events and can plan due to the unique treatment required with this type of blood clot.”
Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said later Tuesday that she expects the pause to last “a matter of days.” More than 6.8 million doses of the single-dose vaccine have been administered in the U.S. J&J shares
lost 1.3%.
Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, replied that the FDA’s announcement should not have a material impact on the national effort to vaccinate.
“Over the last few weeks, we have made available more than 25 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna each week, and in fact this week we will make available 28 million doses of these vaccines,” he added. “This is more than enough supply to continue the current pace of vaccinations of 3 million shots per day, and meet the President’s goal of 200 million shots by his 100th day in office.”
Still, shares of companies that would be hurt the most if the vaccine rollout slows underperformed Tuesday.
Alaska Air and American Airlines both lost 1.5%; car-rental company Avis Budget shed nearly 1%. Shares of Moderna, which makes another coronavirus vaccine, jumped 7.4% following the J&J news, which was reported first by The New York Times.
“I don’t think there’s going to be a huge reaction in the market beyond the knee-jerk reaction we’re getting here right now,” said Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist for Morgan Stanley, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “We’re optimistic, very optimistic that we’re going to be reopened fully in the second half of this year.”"

Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, is wary of large-cap growth tech stocks and sees opportunity in one value name.
“If there was one company that we would be buying and that we’ve owned for many years, that would be Cisco Systems. That one has a P-E multiple of 15 times and enterprise value to EBIT of roughly about 12 times,” Morganlander said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday.
Cisco’s less-than 15 times forward price-to-earnings ratio compares with the S&P 500′s 18 times forward multiple.
“We believe that even with an embedded growth rate of 2% or 3% over the long run, you can get a favorable return. That also has a dividend yield of roughly about 2.9%,” said Morganlander.
Cisco has come under pressure in the past week as the rest of the market sold off. Shares are down 2% since last Wednesday, a steeper decline than the S&P 500′s 1% drop.
Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, has a preference for a more growthy high-momentum stock.
“Take a look at the chart of Netflix,” Johnson said during the same segment. “We chose it number one because they’ve already reported earnings, so if you’re looking to de-risk some of your tech names, this will be one of them.”
Netflix reported better-than-expected earnings and sales when it posted results last week — guidance came in weaker than consensus. The stock has risen 3% since that report.
“Second, the technical setup looks interesting — the shares are moving above their 50- and 200-day moving average. You’re clearing support at $340. It looks like the stock has got about 10% or more upside back to that $385 level, and that’s a name that we could be buying in here at this point,” Johnson added.

, Ulta Beauty
, Baidu
, Walgreens

are still sharply off their own 52-week highs.
A few of those could be investors’ best chance to play catch-up, two traders told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Tuesday.
“We just recently initiated a position in Ulta. I understand that there is investor concern around people not wearing makeup, not getting dressed to go to work, but we think the company is in a strong position, the valuation is attractive to us — it’s not super compelling, but it is attractive,” said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments.
Ulta Beauty trades 43% below its 52-week high but has bounced 71% off its March low. 
“If it goes down a little bit, we’re happy to buy more,” added Tengler. “We do think the online sales growth at 20% to 30% will accelerate and that will pick up some of the lag for the company.”
Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, agrees that some stocks could be poised to pop.
“One, I think, is Cisco. This is a stock that seen a number of higher lows and higher highs. And if it can rally a little bit more and get a major higher high, it’s going to be very bullish,” Maley said.
Maley added that investors should approach with caution ahead of Cisco’s earnings report on Wednesday afternoon, but he notes that the stock typically rebounds from post-earnings declines.
“When it does gap lower, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to go down for an extended period of time. Frequently it bounces back. So either way, whether it bounces higher or bounces lower after those earnings … look at the $45 level, that’s where the trend line from last summer comes in and its 200-day moving average. If it breaks above that, it’s going to start playing catch-up to a lot of those other big cap names,” said Maley
Cisco traded at $43.22 at Tuesday’s close. It is 26% below its July high.

New York officials have also laid out a plan to gradually reopen the state.
“We’re just starting to get some ideas about what some of these economies are looking like as they reopen,” said Megan Horneman, portfolio strategist at Verdence Capital Advisors. “Until we get some more solid data out of that, which is a few weeks away, people are just going to be in limbo for a bit.”
More than 4 million cases have been confirmed globally, according to Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S. alone, over 1.3 million infections have been confirmed. 
Senator Lindsey Graham introduced legislation to require China to cooperate with a coronavirus investigation or face sanctions, pressuring market sentiment. 
Tuesday’s moves came as the Federal Reserve started buying corporate bonds and some of the ETFs that track them. The Fed announced these programs last month as they try to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic. The iShares IBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) climbed 1%. 
“The Fed’s actions so far also point to a willingness to do more if required,” said Oliver Jones, senior market economist at Capital Economics. “The size of the programs could presumably be increased too if market conditions deteriorated, albeit with the Treasury providing more equity.”

Even though there are reopenings, they’re going to go slowly,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “There’s this underlying worry the economy is going to rebound in a slow fashion and we’re still in a deep recession. This was covered up by hopes of reopening and performance of big cap tech.”
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other health officials testified before the Senate Health Committee to discuss reopening the economy. Fauci noted a vaccine will be essential in stopping the coronavirus spread, but warned it will be a while before a usable one is available. Fauci added the U.S. could face more “suffering and death” if states start to reopen too quickly.
“Markets have been torn between optimism on the tentative re-opening of some economies and caution on the still grim economic data,” Mike Pyle, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute, said in a note. “Markets will watch out for any cracks in the financial system and elsewhere in the economy as virus infections climb.”Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, giving back some of their recently strong gains, as investors evaluated the latest attempts to reopen the economy.

Industrial equipment maker Ingersoll-Rand (IR) earned 25 cents per share for the first quarter, 3 cents a share shy of estimates. Revenue beat forecasts. The acquisition of Ingersoll-Rand by Gardner Denver was completed on Feb. 29, with Gardner Denver assuming the Ingersoll-Rand name.
Novavax
 (NVAX) lost 58 cents per share, less than the 70 cents a share loss analysts were expecting. The biotech company’s revenue topped estimates. Novavax also announced that the nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness will provide $384 million new funding for clinical trials of the company’s experimental coronavirus vaccine.
Eventbrite
 (EB) lost $1.71 per share for its first quarter, much wider than the 24 cents a share loss expected by Wall Street. The event management company’s revenue was also well short of forecasts. Eventbrite said ticket sales trends have shown improvement from the mid-March low point, however.
Eldorado
 (ERI) and Caesars Entertainment
 (CZR) both saw double-digit declines in revenue for the first quarter, as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold. Caesars’ revenue was down 14%, while Eldorado saw a nearly 26% decline. Eldorado announced a deal last year to buy Caesars for about $8.6 billion in cash and stock.

As states across America start to ease lockdowns, South Korea and China are experiencing an uptick in cases after restrictions were eased. In the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, officials plan to test its 11 million residents over a 10-day period. Globally, cases approached 4.2 million with 286,615 deaths. The U.S. has had the most infections, more than 1.3 million, including 80,684 deaths. (Reuters)
Coronavirus infection rates are spiking to new highs in several metropolitan areas and smaller communities across the U.S., according to unreleased data the White House’s pandemic task force uses to track new cases. The data, obtained by NBC News, was at odds with the president’s declaration Monday that “all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly.”
A memo to staff Monday directed “everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or facial covering.” The directive, after two staffers tested positive last week, apparently doesn’t apply to the president, according to The Associated Press. Meanwhile, Trump stormed out of Monday’s coronavirus press conference after becoming angry with two reporters: CBS’ Weijia Jiang who asked a question about testing and CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, who didn’t get to ask a question.

He added, however, the S&P 500 is still overbought at current levels even as expectations of a gradual resumption of economic activity continue to increase.
“There will be a reckoning around the reopening and linearity narratives (i.e. both are too sanguine right now),” Crisafulli wrote.
The S&P 500 has rallied more than 33% since hitting an intraday low on March 23. That surge has been led largely by mega-cap tech stocks such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet and Microsoft. Those stocks have all soared more than 20% since late March. Chipmaker Nvidia hit an all-time high on Monday, bringing its 2020 gains to more than 37%.
Stocks that would benefit from the economy reopening are also up sharply since then. MGM Resorts has soared more than 70% while Disney is up about 27% in that time.
But those stocks were down Monday. Disney lost 1.2%. MGM fell 6.0%. United Airlines lost 5.7%.
Despite the market’s strong performance at the index level, Dan Russo of Chaikin Analytics thinks that under the surface, “the real story has been unfolding.”
“Over the past three months, which roughly lines up with the top in the S&P 500, it is the economically sensitive cyclical sectors of the market that have lagged,” the firm’s chief market strategist said in a post, highlighting the performance of energy, financials and industrials over that time period. All three of those sectors are down more than 24% over the past three months.

However, investors remained jittery about reopening the economy too soon, capping the broader market’s upside momentum after South Korea warned of a new cluster of cases involving night clubs. Singapore and Japan also confirmed new cases. The World Health Organization said that countries who have relaxed lockdown measures have seen a spike in coronavirus cases. 
“I think this part of the bounce was easy to forecast, I think what happens from here again depends a lot on Covid stuff,” said Paul Tudor Jones, founder of Tudor Investment Corp., on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “There’ll be a shift in focus from liquidity issues somewhere down the line to solvency issues.

Thursday’s gains came even as another 3.17 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. But while jobless claims continue to rise, last week’s tally was the lowest since shortly after the coronavirus was declared a pandemic.
“As awful as these figures are, it is the least amount of claims since mid March as we’ve likely cycled through the worst of the forced shutdown.

"Stocks rise, lifting Nasdaq to a record, after Trump’s comments on Iran attack ease tensions",EST-20202:27-PM,"— CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.At their worst levels in overnight trading, S&P 500 futures were down more than 1.6% along with Nasdaq 100 futures. Dow futures lost more than 400 points overnight as news of the attack started to surfaced. 
Stocks had been under pressure since last week after news of Soleimani’s death while oil surged, stoking fears of a sharp rise in fuel prices that could dent an already fragile economy. In December, the U.S. manufacturing sector had its biggest contraction in more than a decade.
But Wall Street has history on its side as previous U.S.-Iran crises have seldom led to a prolonged market downturn. Data from Barclays shows that the S&P 500 averages a gain of nearly 3% three months after a confrontation between the two countries. That average gain grows to 5.5% after six months.
“The situation we have today is way different than what we had 10 years ago,” said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. “The U.S. energy renaissance and the shale revolution has turned the U.S. into the marginal oil producer in the world. That’s really put a cap on how high oil can get.”
“The prospect of having a 30% or 40% spike in oil over a short period of time — which can lead to very bad economic outcomes — is way lower now than it was even a decade ago,” Ladner said.

Trump said Iran appeared to be “standing down” after that nation attacked the Ain al-Asad airbase overnight. However, he added the U.S. will “immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime.” News of the attack sent stock futures tumbling overnight. 
“Now, as the president has to some degree defused some of the anxiety, so you’re getting … a little bit of a sigh of relief rally here,” Art Cashin, director of floor operations at the NYSE for UBS, said on CNBC’s “Squawk Alley.”
Oil futures fell from their highest levels of overnight trading, lowering concerns of a possible surge in fuel prices. WTI crude futures were up more than 4% at one point, but settled down nearly 5%.

"S&P 500, Russell 2000 and Nasdaq are at risk of pulling back, charts suggest",EST-20197:27-AM,"New highs, new risks?
The stock market’s surge to fresh records hasn’t come without concern for Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. In fact, he sees risks percolating that could pause the rip-roaring run, he told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Friday.
“We’ve got good news with the Russell 2000
, the S&P [500]
and the Nasdaq
breaking key resistance levels, so, that’s positive. But all three of them are also getting quite overbought, so, it leads me to believe that we … may need to take a breather here early in the new year,” he warned.
Starting with the small-cap-heavy Russell, Maley pointed to the main indicator driving his worry: the relative strength index, or RSI, which tracks a stock’s momentum trends to determine whether it’s overbought or oversold.
“This [index] … hasn’t broken to a new high yet, but it has broken out of an 11-month sideways range,” he said. “Whenever you break out of a multimonth sideways range, especially [one] that long, it’s usually very bullish. But if you look at its RSI chart, not only is it overbought on a short-term basis, but its weekly RSI chart is overbought, as well, and that shows that on an intermediate-term basis, it’s getting to levels where it has been followed by pullbacks in the past … and, in some cases, fairly deep pullbacks.”
Same goes for the S&P 500, Maley said. While the index has repeatedly reached new all-time intraday highs — 34 this year, to be exact, including Friday — its weekly RSI chart is also starting to get a bit stretched, he said.
“Its weekly RSI chart [is] getting quite extended, and again, at levels where it has been followed by, at least, corrections of 5% or more over the last two years,” the strategist said.
Last but far from least was the chart of the Nasdaq Composite index, which reached the 9,000 record milestone in Thursday’s session.
“It’s had an unbelievably great breakout, well above its November highs, but it’s the most overbought of the bunch,” Maley said. “Again, it gives me concerns that over the near term, once we get into the new year and past this kind of year-end euphoria, you may see a little bit of a pullback.”
Still, as concerning as this seemed, Maley didn’t want to sound the sell alarm just yet.
“That’s not saying, ‘Oh my gosh, you’ve got to sell, the market’s going to zero, it’s going to flip over,’” he said. “But people with new money who’d like to put new money to work might want to keep a little bit of dry powder and, as they add a little bit into the new year, look for those dips of 5% or maybe even more to add to their favorite names.”
Steve Chiavarone, a vice president, portfolio manager and equity strategist at Federated Investors, echoed that sentiment.
“Of course we’re going to have a pullback,” the money manager said in the same “Trading Nation” interview. “Markets aren’t going to go up in a straight line. I think the issue, though, is that we didn’t have an over-bullish sentiment coming into this run, and so everyone wants to get into this market.”
In Chiavarone’s experience, “if everyone’s waiting for a 5% pullback,” the likelier outcome will probably be a 2% or 3% drop, which means investors should take advantage of down days, he said.
“We think you have to be aggressive on buying any dips as they come because we think the fundamental setup is good,” he said. “We’ve got a 3,500 target for [the S&P] next year based on the idea that economic growth, corporate earnings and manufacturing have bottomed and are rebounding and rates are staying low, and we think that’s bullish.”
As such, Chiavarone had one catch-up play he recommended buying.
“If you’re looking to add somewhere, yeah, you probably don’t want to go out and buy growth right now,” he said. “But when you look at that Russell 2000, small caps, as well as they’ve done, they’ve underperformed the S&P by 6% this year. So, we think that there’s opportunities in small caps, value and even some internationally, particularly emerging markets, that aren’t as expensive. And if you want to do some buying, those look like pretty good places.”

Norwegian Cruise Line dropped 4.9% following the news, while Royal Caribbean and Carnival fell 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. Delta and United Airlines also ended the day lower.
The tech sell-off came even as bond yields continued to decline from recent highs. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped 3 basis points to 1.61% Wednesday, falling for a third day after the rate hit a 14-month high last week.
One bright spot on Wednesday was the energy sector, which gained 2.5% as oil prices bounced back 6%. The material and financial sectors also outperformed, rising about 0.7% each.
“Stocks encountered volatility but powered ahead in the first quarter. Cyclical stocks — those sensitive to economic momentum — continued to lead,” said Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer of U.S. fundamental equities at BlackRock. “We think it makes sense to position for the start of a new and powerful economic cycle.”
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen appeared for a second day for virtual Capitol Hill testimony. Talking with members of the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said he expects the economy to experience superior growth in 2021 amid a recovery from the pandemic.
“There’s going to be a very, very strong year in the most likely case,” Powell said. “There are of course risks to the upside and downside, but it should be a very strong year from a growth standpoint...Longer run we do have to raise revenue to support permanent spending that we want to do.”

The markets soared heading into the final month of the year, with the S&P 500
gaining over 25% in the first 11 months of 2019. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has gained at least 20% from January through November on six other occasions, and following those years, the U.S. stock market boom continues across all three of the major domestic equity indices.
The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite
have turned in big years — measured in the December to December annual period — 100% of the time after similar S&P 500 gains through November. The S&P and Nasdaq gains have averaged above 18%, while the Dow has posted an average gain of 15%.
Of course, past performance does not guarantee future results. With the 2020 presidential election on the horizon, this time could be different.Since 1990 there have been six occurrences of the S&P 500 posting a gain over 20% through November.
In the one-year period that follows, starting December, the S&P has posted big returns every time.

“In 2020, it was growth, tech and momentum that led the markets, and really from November on, it’s been a reversal into value, dividends and quality,” Petrides said Tuesday.
He was also optimistic about the long-term prospects for growth.
“By this rotation in and out between value and growth, you’re having a horizontal construction of the board that is broadening out, which is an overall bullish sign for stocks in the long term,” Petrides said.
Tesla

Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, attributed the move to the company’s growth prospects.
“Technologies set themselves so far ahead. The gains are astronomical,” he said in the same “Trading Nation” interview. “Revenue is about $31.5 billion this year, going to be $48 [billion] on projections for next year.”
Gordon also noted recent confidence in Tesla’s innovation from Cathie Wood, founder, CEO and CIO of Ark Investment Management, as a potential catalyst for further momentum.
“If [Tesla CEO] Elon [Musk] can link their fleet of passenger cars and maybe a taxi service, I think the autonomous game might be over,” Gordon added. “I think that’s why Tesla’s trading with such a high PE.”

The moves came as the number of coronavirus cases crossed the 3 million mark, according to the latest data by the Government of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. India currently has the third largest number of coronavirus cases globally, behind the U.S. and Brazil, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Overall, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index gained 0.93%.
John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, told CNBC’s “Street Signs” Monday that the firm is currently “neutral” on stocks at the moment.
“We have felt over the last six to eight weeks that there was a likelihood and risk of some sort of pullback particularly inspired by potential geopolitical concerns. We also had the sense that maybe valuations were looking a little stretched and there was likely to be some rotation from U.S. to Europe,” Woods said. Still, he added that the “longer-term picture still looks positive.”
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering fast tracking an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed in the U.K. for use stateside ahead of the nation’s upcoming presidential election, according to a Financial Times report.The first batch of firms listing on mainland China’s Nasdaq-style ChiNext board under its revised IPO system made their debut on Monday and saw staggering gains. Contec Medical Systems jumped more than 1,000% on the day while Ningbo KBE Electrical Technology surged more than 740%.
Under the new listing system, stocks on the ChiNext will be allowed to trade freely in the first five days from their debut. Following which, new regulations also now allow stocks on the board to gain or lose up to 20% in a session, as compared with 10% previously."
"Dow rallies 200 points to start August, Nasdaq closes at record led by Microsoft and Apple",EDT-20204:22-PM,"To be sure, investor attention has also turned to Washington as Covid-19 stimulus negotiations continue.
“Increased unemployment claims and decreasing consumer confidence show some deterioration of the U.S. consumer backdrop,” wrote Dennis DeBusschere, market strategist at Evercore ISI.
“If an agreement to extend unemployment support passes soon, the nascent Cyclical/risk-on rally from earlier in July can continue,” he added. “Until then, risk-on factors will face headwinds despite the sharp decline in COVID net hospitalizations.”
Republican and Democratic lawmakers remain at a standstill over some components of the next coronavirus relief legislation. 
The key debate that separates the two parties is the federal boost to unemployment assistance, which was set at $600 per week in March but recently expired. While the White House has come out in favor of reducing the federal assistance to $200 a week, Democrats have called for keeping it at the $600 level.
Other provisions, such as another round of $1,200 stimulus checks, have broader support from both political parties.
Traders and economists alike are also eager for the July jobs report, which the Labor Department is scheduled to release on Friday. 
The once-a-month jobs update will be of critical importance this month, especially since the number of people filing for unemployment benefits has been edging higher. According to Dow Jones, about 1.264 million new jobs are expected, well below the 4.8 million added in June, and the unemployment rate is expected to fall to 10.6% from 11.1%.
Still, market moves around the release could be mixed given the disparity in forecasts. Some economists expect more than 2 million jobs were added, and some even see flat or negative payrolls.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed 236.08 points higher, or 0.9%, at 26,664.40. The Nasdaq Composite
jumped 1.5% to an all-time high, ending the day at 10,902.80. The S&P 500
gained 0.7% to 3,294.61, its highest closing level since Feb. 21. The S&P 500 is also within 3% of reaching an all-time high. 
Shares of major tech companies led the way higher for the broader market. Microsoft gained more than 5% after confirming reports about being in talks to buy social video app TikTok in the U.S. The talks come even as President Donald Trump threatens to ban TikTok because of security concerns over its parent company’s ties to China. Apple and Netflix rose 2.5% and 2%, respectively. 
“We’re seeing a rally in the tech sector really follow through from some of the earnings reports we saw last week,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at D.A. Davidson. “The S&P 500 is a bit above our estimate of fair value, though. If we look out down the road, you could certainly see the market trade higher, but we need better visibility” on the economy and the coronavirus pandemic. 
Some of the other factors driving the market higher included:
Eli Lilly announcing the start of a phase 3 trial of LY-CoV555, an experimental coronavirus antibody treatment that may prevent the virus from spreading among U.S. nursing home staffers and residents. The stock gained 1.7%.
Stocks got a boost from better-than-expected manufacturing data. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI rose to 54.2 in July, topping a Dow Jones estimate of 53.8.
Investors also cheered an earnings season in which companies are beating estimates at a record rate. Data compiled by FactSet showed that, through Friday, 84% of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings expectations. If beat rate stays at that level, it will be the highest since FactSet started tracking the metric in 2008.
The major averages were coming off their fourth consecutive monthly gain in July, with the S&P 500 rising 5.5% and the Nasdaq jumping more than 6% in that time period. The Dow gained 2.4% last month."
Nasdaq executive is ‘bullish’ on WeWork and hopes the company will go public eventually,EDT-20191:56-AM,"The company had been set to run out of cash by mid-November, CNBC reported last week. As part of the bailout, which could be announced as soon as Tuesday, Neumann will get roughly $1.7 billion from SoftBank to walk away from the company, according to a Wall Street Journal report.
At the event on Tuesday, Nasdaq’s Knight maintained there’s a “great story in WeWork.” He said Neumann had been successful in attracting capital and “disrupting the whole real estate market in the United States with his idea.”
“I think that idea will eventually have a place in the public markets and the retail public will be able to invest in it, and hopefully it will be on Nasdaq,” he said.A top Nasdaq executive defended WeWork
on Tuesday, saying he hopes the workspace company will “eventually” list on the exchange even as it faces an expected bailout by Japan’s SoftBank.
In a fireside conversation at the Fintech Abu Dhabi conference, Nasdaq Vice Chairman Edward Knight said he is “bullish” on WeWork in the long term.
“We hope eventually it will list on Nasdaq,” Knight said.
WeWork pulled its plans for an initial public offering on the exchange in September as investors became skeptical after the company’s massive losses and the leadership of former CEO Adam Neumann.
On Monday, CNBC reported Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is in advanced talks to take control of WeWork in a deal that would value the company at between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion on a prefunding basis.

"This tech stock could weather another Nasdaq downturn, trader says",EST-20198:27-AM,"The Nasdaq 100
tried to break above December highs … but failed.
Earlier this week, the index came close to its Dec. 3 peak. That top preceded a slump that took the index down 15 percent for the month.
Whether the Nasdaq is in for another tumble or not, Strategic Wealth Partners’ Mark Tepper sees one stock that could weather a downturn.
“We like Salesforce
,” Tepper said on CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday. “When we look at tech in general, we really like software more so than we like hardware or semis.”
Salesforce shares are up 9 percent during the past three months as of Thursday’s close, far better than the 4 percent decline on the Nasdaq 100. They were down 1.8 percent in Friday’s premarket.
“When you look at a company like Salesforce, they’ve got a lot going for them. Yes, the valuation is high, but it’s really justified,” said Tepper. “They have sticky customers. It’s very expensive to get that platform customized and off the ground, they have recurring revenues which is worth two to three times as much as one-time revenues, and I believe that their revenues are essentially recession proof.”
While Salesforce could head higher, one technician says the broader Nasdaq 100 is in for a rough stretch.
“It’s actually how scary how significant this resistance that is keeping the market down,” said TradingAnalysis.com’s Todd Gordon. “This 200-day moving average, it just seems to define this whole market. You can see we’ve come right up to test it.”
The Nasdaq 100 has not traded firmly above its 200-day moving average since October. The long-term trend line has also flatlined after a steady climb since late 2016.
“The other thing traders will look at is retracement levels. We’ve retraced roughly two-thirds or specifically 61 percent,” Gordon said. “This is a resistance level that should have held, it is holding. I’m a little nervous about that.”
Gordon pinpoints its 61 percent retracement at around 6,953. The Nasdaq 100 was less than 1 percent below that level by market close Thursday.
“I think for now, it looks like lower. Is this going to be a long-term top? I don’t think so but I think a couple days of volatility,” Gordon added.

Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta’s online betting company is now publicly traded on Nasdaq,EDT-20206:27-PM,"Landry’s CEO and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta will allow the public to buy stock in his new online gaming company. But they won’t be able to wager on Houston Rockets games.
The company joins Draftkings
as the only other publicly traded online-only casino company in the U.S.
The State of New Jersey initially restricted Fertitta’s company from including National Basketball Association games, but last September approved NBA bets under the condition wagers excluded Rockets contests. Owners of sports franchises were banned from offering wagers for pro leagues in which they they owned a team.
The online casino company will arise after Fertitta used a blank check entity, Landcadia Holdings II, to buy New Jersey-based Golden Nugget Online Gaming, according to an SEC filing on June 29. Golden Nugget is now active on the Nasdaq stock exchange under Landcadia Holdings II (LCA)
. The company will eventually re-adopt the Golden Nugget name and change its ticker to GNOG, the filing said.
Lancadia was co-sponsored by Fertitta Entertainment, which owns the Rockets and will retain 52 percent of Golden Nugget stock, and Jefferies.
According to the filing, Fertitta’s new company is valued at $745 million.
The U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on sports betting in 2018, 18 states to allow wagers. Currently, 18 states are active with four awaiting startup operations as officials look to take advantage of a market projected to grow to $8 billion by 2025.
In an interview with CNBC’s “Power Lunch” on June 23, Fertitta predicted the online gambling sector, which could surpass $90 billion by 2025, would expand “everywhere in the country because of the taxes,” he said. “The iGaming market is so much more profitable and bigger than the sports gaming market.”
In addition to operations in New Jersey, Golden Nugget plans to expand in Pennsylvania and Michigan in 2021.

Nasdaq’s recent ‘golden cross’ is bullish signal for rest of April: Wall Street A.I. trading tool,EDT-20199:43-AM,"Stocks already have rallied off their late December lows in 2019, a bullish period attributed primarily to the Federal Reserve pause in interest-rate hikes and building investor optimism for a trade deal between the U.S. and China.
On Wednesday, Fed minutes from its March monetary meeting were released and showed that the central bank intends to keep rates unchanged for the rest of the year. The Nasdaq finished up 0.7% on Wednesday.
“A majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year,” the minutes said.
On market expectations for a trade deal between the U.S. and China, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday that the U.S. and China have “pretty much agreed on an enforcement mechanism” for when a deal is struck and said recent talks between the two countries have been “productive,” though he would not set a deadline for when a deal could be reached.The Nasdaq Composite
joined recent rallies in other U.S. stock markets with its own “golden cross” during the first week in April.
Here’s what that term means:
When the short-term moving average (usually 50-day) of an index or security crosses above a long-term moving average (usually 200-day).
Last week the experienced a golden cross for the first time in three years. In late March the Dow Jones Industrial Average
saw the closely watched trading pattern unfold.
Investors have typically viewed this as a bullish sign that gains will continue.
Since 1980, the Nasdaq has experienced a “golden cross” 16 times and the index has continued higher 75% of the time, according to a CNBC analysis of Kensho, which provides a trading analytics tool used by Wall Street banks and institutional investors.
On average, the Nasdaq was up more than 2% a month later. The S&P 500 also performed well in that one-month period.
Since the Nasdaq hit the golden cross last Wednesday, it has continued higher, up 0.87% over the past five trading days since last Thursday and positive in three of the five trading sessions.A stock market trading analysis run by Wall Street machine-learning tool Kensho shows that the Nasdaq continues on a bullish streak after it experiences a “golden cross.”

So I wouldn’t be surprised to see more of a rolling back-and-forth market rather than one that goes straight up like we’ve seen the past few months.”
More than 2.93 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the U.S. along with at least 130,306 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Over the weekend, more than 20 states reported a hospitalization growth rate of at least 5% 
Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic also told The Financial Times the U.S. economic recovery will be “bumpier” as coronavirus cases continue to rise. 
Positive news on the coronavirus front gave the market a boost earlier on Tuesday. The U.S. government awarded drugmaker Novavax a $1.6 billion contract to develop a coronavirus vaccine, the biggest amount yet granted under the White House’s “Operation Warp Speed.” Novavax
shares were up 37%.
Wall Street was coming off strong day that saw the Dow jump more than 450 points.
“While we expect continued volatility, we think there are grounds for optimism that economies and markets can weather the recent acceleration in infections,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS, said in a note. “There are signs that healthcare systems are coping better with COVID-19, reducing the need for restrictions on freedom of movement. Economic data continues to point to resilience.”Stocks fell on Tuesday as a rally in mega-cap tech shares lost steam and concerns about the coronavirus outbreak dampened investor sentiment.

Shares of Amazon fell 1.9% to lead tech lower. Netflix closed 0.1% lower after hitting a record earlier in the day. Microsoft, Apple and Facebook ended the session off their highs.
Both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 snapped five-day winning streaks. The Dow posted its first decline in three sessions. 
“This market is way overbought,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “This market has been ignoring the potential problems that are going to arise from the coronavirus.”

"IPO demand is strong for 2020, the heads of the NYSE and Nasdaq say",EST-202010:28-AM,"2020 is going to be a strong year for initial public offerings, according to the presidents of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
“We are having a lot of meetings, a lot of interest, a lot of companies looking to tap the public markets in the first half,” Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Thursday from the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos.
“We have roughly 30 or so companies that have already filed with the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission], many more that are talking to us and looking to list in 2020,” echoed NYSE President Stacey Cunningham on “Squawk Box.”
Although 2019 was the best IPO market since 2014, Cunningham noted, only a “handful got a lot of attention.”
2019 was plagued with some disappointing market debuts and failures. Some highly anticipated technology companies in the IPO stages, such as Uber and Lyft, and pre-IPO stages, like WeWork, made headlines for their lack of profitability. The public markets spoke and Uber and Lyft ended the year as some of the most disappointing public offerings.
“I think what we saw at the end of the year is investors asking questions they hadn’t really been asking before. Investors are looking for not just growth, but profits,” said Cunningham.
Lyft
, Peloton
, Beyond Meat
, SmileDirectClub
and Zoom
all went public on the Nasdaq in 2019. Uber
, Pinterest
, Virgin Galantic
, Chewy
and Levi Strauss

“Right now the pipeline of prospects, IPO prospects, is very strong, very interesting,” said Friedman.
Friedman said there is strong demand from both private equity held companies as well as technology companies. Biotechnology and financial technology companies also continue to be strong parts of the industry, Friedman added.
“The first couple that come out of the gate will really set the tone for the year,” said Cunningham.
“I think also the resiliency of the economy has been very strong and so you’re seeing that and I think that there’s more and more confidence coming into the markets,” said Friedman. “People feel like its the right time for investors to take that equity risk.”Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman and New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham both see strong demand for initial public stock offerings in 2020.

Nasdaq Dubai launches Saudi futures in bid to diversify investor offering,EST-20195:36-AM,"But the country of 33 million has seen drops in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows of late, something it needs for its ambitious Vision 2030 initiative to diversify the country’s economy and grow private sector jobs. Obstacles remain in the form of skills shortages, lower oil prices and rising unemployment in the kingdom, as well as growing international concern over the unpredictability and repressive tactics of the kingdom’s powerful young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.
Ultimately, foreign investors “will continue to crave visibility, guidance and clarity that comes with a transparent and accountable operating environment in Saudi Arabia,” Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at bank MUFG, told CNBC via email.
“We’ll see positive results when those changes and reforms that Saudi intends to do materialize,” Nasdaq’s Ali said. “I think the decisive factor will be to what extent Saudi delivers on those reforms, because those can only bring positive change.”
Meanwhille, Talal Assad Touqan, head of research and advisory at Dubai-based Brokerage House Securities, doesn’t see negative press on Saudi Arabia dampening demand for the product, since investors can choose to go long or short. “What matters at this point in time is ... giving people the opportunity to bet on the Saudi economy whether on an optimistic view or pessimistic, and on the other hand to widen the set of opportunities and give more diversification to the UAE portfolio,” he said.
The exchange launched UAE futures trading in 2016 with single stock futures on seven companies. With more UAE companies added since then as well as the Saudi contracts, Nasdaq Dubai currently offers single stock futures on 29 regional companies.The Nasdaq Dubai has launched futures trading on shares of 12 Saudi Arabian companies, its first single stock futures outside of the United Arab Emirates. The move aims to diversify financial offerings to regional and international investors, allowing them to both invest in and trade Saudi companies on the Emirati exchange.
The companies now available for futures trading on the Dubai exchange comprise a market capitalization of 794 billion Saudi riyals ($212 billion) and cover sectors including real estate, mining, banks, industrial materials and petrochemicals.
“This is a very good opportunity for investors out of the region to be able to hedge or take positions, long or short, when it comes to Saudi markets,” Nasdaq Dubai Chief Executive Hamed Ali told CNBC on Wednesday. “It’s a product that complements the current Saudi market, rather than competes with it.”
Futures are financial products used to speculate on the price movement of an underlying asset. Going short is betting that a company’s share price will fall.
Despite weakened international confidence in Saudi Arabia after a slew of political controversies over the last year, the Nasdaq Dubai’s senior management see promise in the oil-rich kingdom’s reform agenda. Ali emphasized his confidence on Saudi Arabia’s planned reforms toward a more open economy and remained optimistic on the country’s outlook.
Indeed, the kingdom’s inclusion in the MSCI emerging markets index slated for this year is expected to attract some $15 billion in passive funds and several billions more in active funds. Investors have pointed to Riyadh’s easing of some regulatory requirements and adoption of international best practice procedures as signs of progress.The Nasdaq Dubai on Wednesday launched futures trading on shares of 12 Saudi Arabian companies, its first single stock futures outside of the United Arab Emirates.

"Dow jumps 150 points, Apple leads Nasdaq to record close",EDT-20204:15-PM,"But the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases across the U.S. and elsewhere in the world continues to increase, raising questions about the global economic recovery.
“The areas of concern that weighed on stocks Friday afternoon were reinforced over the weekend,” Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge wrote in a note. “Governments look set to proceed with reopening, but the real driver of growth will be behavioral normalization and that is very likely to be impended by the steady negative coronavirus news flow.”
The U.S. reported more than 30,000 additional coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number of confirmed one-day infections since May 1, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. Nevada, Florida, California and Arizona have reported record-high single-day infections.
The recent coronavirus uptick in some states led Apple to reclose some of its stores. Meanwhile, a trade group said cruise lines voluntarily suspended all trips until Sept. 15.
“There’s a war going on between the bulls and bears, with each seizing every little data point to buttress their opposing arguments,” said Vito Racanelli, market intelligence analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors, in a note.
“I do think that perhaps the market has gone past its recovery ‘straight-up’ phase, as investors realized coronavirus (COVID-19) was not a world ender,” Racanelli said. “But the data remains mixed and Covid-19 fear remains strong, and it’s understandable.”

—CNBC’s Yun Li and Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Stocks rose on Monday, building on solid gains from last week, as shares of major tech companies led the way higher on Wall Street. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
gained 153.50 points, or 0.6%, to close at 26,024.96. The Nasdaq Composite
posted a record closing high, advancing 1.1% to 10,056.47. The S&P 500
ended the session up 0.7% at 3,117.86. The major averages briefly pared some of their gains towards the end of the session, after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told reporters the coronavirus is spreading at an unacceptable rate.
Apple shares jumped more than 2% and hit a record high after the company made a slew of announcement at its annual WorldWide Developers Conference. The tech giant unveiled the latest version of iOS, its mobile operating system. Apple also said its new Mac computers will no longer use Intel chips. 
Microsoft climbed more than 2% to lead the Dow higher. Amazon advanced 1.5%. Netflix gained 2.6%. Facebook eked out a small gain.
Retail names, which are directly linked to the economic reopening, were also among the biggest gainers. Shares of Gap were higher by 8.3%, boosted by an upgrade at Wells Fargo, citing the retailer’s “under-appreciated value and optionality.” Walmart gained more than 1% after an upgrade by UBS. 
Shares of American Airlines — which are also linked to the recovery — were lower by 6.8% after the company said it was seeking new financing. United fell 0.8%. Reopening trades such as casino and hotel stocks were also under pressure with Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts down 4% and 2.4%, respectively.
“Investors are using the market as a proxy for getting back to normal,” said Kim Forrest, founder of Bokeh Capital. “If too many people get sick, they’re going to shut down parts of the economy and the market will react.”
“I’m just looking for that first state shutdown or area shutdown in the U.S. That’s going to remind investors of what happened this spring,” Forrest said. 
The major U.S. stock averages are coming off their fourth weekly gain in five weeks. Both the Dow and S&P 500 advanced at least 1% last week, while the Nasdaq Composite surged more than 3%."
"Dow snaps 6-day winning streak, but tech stocks lift Nasdaq Composite to record 10,000 level",EDT-20204:22-PM,"But some investors are starting to wonder whether the move has gone too far, too fast considering the economy as just started to reopen. The Federal Reserve begins a two-day meeting Tuesday.
All in, the S&P 500 is up 46% from its March low. Much of those gains have been thanks to the so-called reopening trade, those stocks that would benefit the most if all the Covid-19 precautions and business closures were removed.
Airline shares, which swooned in March amid travel restrictions and contagion fears, have been one of the strongest groups of late. Delta, United and American Airlines are up 50.4%, 75.6% and 82.9% over the last month alone. Another “reopening” group, cruise line operators Carnival
 and Norwegian Cruise Line
 are up 62.1% and 94.1% over the same period. 
“Equities continue to trend higher in anticipation of improving economic conditions,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “But I think it’s premature to declare happy days are here again.”
“What gives us caution is the duration of Covid-19 remains unknown,” said Sandven. “We don’t have treatments, we don’t have prevention and we’re a little bit at the mercy of how fast the virus spreads.”
Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.The S&P 500 leaped 1.2% and turned positive for the year in the prior session in a quick about-face following the springtime fears over the virus. At one point this year, the S&P 500 was down more than 30% from its all-time highs. It was positive for 2020 by 0.05% by Monday’s close but Tuesday’s losses put it back down 0.6% year to date. 
Those sharp gains came even as the official economic arbiter in the U.S. declared that the economy entered a recession earlier this year. The National Bureau of Economic Research determined that a “clear peak in monthly economic activity” occurred in February. 
Traders say the market’s hot streak over the last two months is in large part thanks to confidence about the reopening of the U.S. economy and a barrage of government stimulus. 
Market optimists pointed to improving economic signals for the most recent rallies, including the government’s far-better-than-expected jobs report last week. The Labor Department said Friday the economy added 2.5 million jobs in May, a record. Economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast a drop of more than 8 million.
“Recent data points like the jobs report and not-as-bad-as-feared company updates have fueled the view that the worst of the declines could be behind us,” a team of RBC Capital Markets analysts told clients Monday. “The risk-on trade really is gaining traction. Valuations have spiked to historical highs in many industrial sub-sectors, signaling a strong recovery is potentially taking hold.”United Airlines and Delta Air Lines each dropped more than 7.5%. Cruise lines Carnival and Royal Caribbean declined 7.5% and 10.1%, respectively. Retail-related trades Gap and Simon Property Group dropped as well. 
“Today’s all about giving back some of the sharp gains we’ve seen in those value names,” said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT. Buchanan said several factors — including last week’s record-setting jobs report — are signaling a much quicker-than-expected turnaround following and have boosted beaten-down stocks such as airlines and cruise lines. “The upcoming economic data is going to be even more important. To confirm that payrolls number is critical.”

Continued tensions between the U.S. and China have threatened Chinese firms listed on Wall Street. In December, President Donald Trump signed legislation that threatened to delist firms that don’t comply with American auditing standards.
That could be one reason behind the rise of secondary listings in Hong Kong.
The video platform is aimed at China’s younger generations and mobile games is its largest revenue driver. Bilibili also hosts live broadcasts during which users can buy virtual items. It also makes money from advertising.GUANGZHOU, China — Chinese video platform Bilibili has confidentially filed for a secondary listing in Hong Kong, a source close to the matter told CNBC.
Bilibili
, which is currently listed on the Nasdaq, made the filing within the last few days, the source said.
CNBC reported last week that the listing could raise over $2 billion and the filing was to be expected last week or beginning of this week.
Companies already listed on another major exchange can confidentially file for a secondary listing on Hong Kong’s stock exchange as a way to prevent a major impact on its share price. The filing is not public yet.

"S&P 500 closes little changed, Nasdaq inches higher to a record in shortened session",EST-20191:05-PM,"The S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq Composite edged higher to another new record in muted Christmas Eve trading.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average

finished the day little changed at 3,223.38. The Nasdaq Composite
rose slightly to hit a new record high of 8,952.88, posting its ninth consecutive record close for the first time since 1998. Trading was subdued in the holiday session and the market was closed at 1 p.m. ET.
The three major averages all posted record closes on Monday. The S&P 500 has risen 2.6% for December and 8.2% for the quarter. It is also on pace for its best annual performance in six years, up 28.6% for 2019 through Monday’s close. If the benchmark ends the year up more than 29.6%, it will score the best year since 1997.
“The equity narrative is the same as it was at Monday’s close and probably will stay unchanged for the remaining 1.5 weeks of 2019,” Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. “But investors will return in January to find a complacent market trading at very elevated multiples and harboring unrealistically optimistic expectations about an upward inflection in growth/earnings momentum.”
The S&P 500 is currently trading at about 18 times forward earnings, the highest level since January 2018, according to FactSet.
Tuesday marked the official start of the Santa Claus rally period, which happens on the final five trading days of the year and the first two tradings days of the new year. Stocks tend to have unusually strong performance during those trading days with the S&P 500
averaging a 1.3% gain since 1950, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac.
Investors cheered the news this week that China is taking action to goose its economy. The country said it will boost imports by cutting tariffs on over 850 products. The Chinese government also said it would study additional cuts in the bank reserve-ratio requirements. The moves come as China and the U.S. agreed on a phase one trade deal and are working to ink the agreement.
President Donald Trump said Tuesday the trade deal with China is getting done, adding there will be a signing ceremony with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Mall operator Simon Property gained 15.4%. Kohl’s and Nordstrom advanced 11% and 6%, respectively.“The unemployment rate was solid; the participation rate was higher. This checks all the boxes for a solid report,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. “So even though this was coming off a horrendous report the previous month, there’s nothing that screams this is some sort of error that can be ignored. If anything, it suggests we should be looking for more good news next month.”
The report boosted confidence of a swift economic recovery among traders, leading them into stocks that would benefit the most from a broad reopening. Stocks rallied on Friday after an unexpected surge in U.S. jobs raised hope that the economy is starting to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

NYSE challenges Nasdaq’s reign as king of the tech IPO,EDT-20189:25-AM,"A breakdown of the figures shows that the average IPO size for the NYSE is higher than Nasdaq. Although Nasdaq has gained more tech listings — 183 for Nasdaq versus 160 for NYSE since 2010 — NYSE has won the bigger tech IPOs in recent years. All told, the tech listings on NYSE have raised $74.4bn since 2010 compared with $49.6bn for Nasdaq.
NYSE and Nasdaq retain different listing standards, which can affect decision making. NYSE listing fees for companies are capped at $500,000 a year versus $155,000 a year at Nasdaq.
Both Spotify and Dropbox declined to comment, but executives of other tech companies indicated the choice of exchange is a personal one.
Tien Tzuo, the chief executive of Zuora, which sells software that enables companies to transform into subscription businesses, said its customers, which include Caterpillar
, were increasingly NYSE-listed and “it was important to be there with them”.
By contrast, Rob Bernshteyn, chief executive of Coupa, said Nasdaq helped the provider of spending management services for companies to make valuable contacts. “I was introduced to John Chambers [the former executive chairman of Cisco Systems] and it developed into a mentoring relationship,” he said.
The pageantry of NYSE’s storied digs in Manhattan’s financial district and the thrill of ringing the opening bell on listing day count for some. For Mr Bernshteyn, it was important to have as many colleagues with him as possible. NYSE has a limit of 14 guests on its podium largely because of fire code reasons, while up to 75 can share the Nasdaq stage for the market open in Times Square.
While listing fees are not a major contributor to the revenues of either Nasdaq or NYSE’s parent ICE, victory in the battle for tech listings is not a pyrrhic one. The close of daily trading in a company’s shares must happen at the home exchange, and with the proliferation of index-based investing and exchange traded funds, a higher volume of trading has gravitated to the end of the day.
Yet if more tech unicorns do go public, the big prize for these competing exchanges may ultimately be something far more intangible: branding.
“If you are NYSE and Nasdaq and you cannot get anyone to list on your venue,” said Kyle Martin, a research analyst at Westwood Holdings, “who are you?”

The 30 minutes that have an outsized role in US stock trading
Alphabet boosts spending as revenues soarJohn Tuttle, head of listings at NYSE, admits the exchange was “slow to catch on” as a series of now high-profile companies such as Amazon
listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq suffered a black eye with Facebook
’s 2012 IPO in which technical mishaps contributed to a delayed and chaotic opening for the stock, further encouraging the NYSE.
The exchange, which is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange, ultimately caught on to the idea that tech companies would be new titans of industry, changed its listing standards and began aggressively recruiting in Silicon Valley. NYSE’s share of the number of tech deals has boomed from the single digits in the late 1990s to 52 per cent from 2013 to 2015, according to Dealogic.
“NYSE was always home to innovative companies — tech is the next phase in innovation,” said Mr Tuttle. “We modernised our listing standards to meet the demands of companies in the 21st century.”
In January, NYSE recruited Jose Cobos, a San Francisco banker and former Navy Seal to lead its charge for tech listings. NYSE also modified its rules for direct listings in February, a move it hopes sets the stage for other tech “decacorns”, or unicorns valued at $10bn or more, that may want to try Spotify’s approach and list its shares without raising any new money.
Nasdaq has not been without recent successes. Cloud storage company Dropbox
picked Nasdaq when it raised $869m in a flotation last month. And at its headquarters in Times Square, Nasdaq has given exchange veteran Nelson Griggs oversight of its corporation solutions business, which sells companies investor relations and board services, as well as listings, to solidify part of the Nasdaq’s pitch to companies of both offerings.
“The rationale to combine them is that in many cases they have the same end customer: corporate CEOs, CFOs as well as board members,” Mr Griggs said.
Although NYSE dominated in 2017 with 51 per cent of deals and 80 per cent of money raised, Nasdaq captured 85 per cent of tech listings in 2016 and so far this year is leading with 54 per cent, Dealogic data show.
“The numbers point to the fact that we are recovering from Facebook,” said Mr Griggs, president Nasdaq stock exchange.Ever since high-profile tech listings burst into the public imagination more than two decades ago, the Nasdaq stock exchange has been synonymous with the online giants that have helped define the modern era.
But in little over a year Nasdaq’s cross-town rivals at the New York Stock Exchange have landed the two highest-profile listings: the $3.9bn raised by messaging app Snapchat’s parent in March 2017 and the listing of music streaming service Spotify
this month.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comAmazon doesn’t have direct exposure to the IPO market, but there is a high chance that its cloud segment does business with the company that’s filing, Cramer said.
Snap Inc. had $1 billion worth of business with Amazon Web Services at its initial offering, the host said. In Lyft’s case, the ride-hailing company will pay the Amazon’s cloud arm $300 million over the next three years, he said. While Pinterest is set to pay the company $750 million over a six-year period through 2023, he added.
“Amazon Web Services dominates this business. Their next largest competitors, [Alphabet
subsidiary] Google and Microsoft
, don’t even come close,” Cramer said. “So as we see this parade of tech IPOs ... it’s telling us how much — each one of them seems to have a deal with Amazon.”
AWS revenue grew 47 percent in 2018.The investment banks that underwrite an IPO are well compensated, Cramer said. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan handled the Levi’s and Lyft offerings, respectively, and both firms will play a role in Pinterest’s listing this year, he noted.
“Goldman Sachs is a pure-play investment bank ... their underwriting business is much more of a needle-mover than JP Morgan
,” he said. “They win a bunch of these deals and it will really bolster their earnings power ... The IPO boom could be the catalyst that finally gets this, the cheapest on a price-to-earnings multiple brokerage stock that there is, [moving].”
Uber is going through its public offering process with Morgan Stanley
, which should be a “lucrative” deal for the bank, Cramer said.
“Again, the financials are an unloved group, but these IPOs give you a reason to bet on the investment banks,” he said.Cramer said investors can buy the stock exchanges that will list the oncoming IPOs. The usual suspects on the U.S. market are the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, he said.
“Given where most of these deals are coming, I think Nasdaq
’s stock is the way to go,” Cramer said.
Levi Strauss
went public less than two weeks ago on the NYSE
, but was the only new name to list on that market in the first quarter. The Nasdaq brought 17 deals, including Lyft, to market in the first three months of the year, he noted.
Additionally, Lyft was the Nasdaq’s largest IPO since the faulty debut of Facebook
on the tech-focused exchange in 2012. At the time, Facebook’s stumble worried many tech companies, which pushed notable names such as Twitter
, Alibaba
, and Snap Inc.
to list on the NYSE, Cramer said.
Uber and Pinterest have also opted for the NYSE, but the host thinks the Nasdaq is in position to land big deals in the future.
“Nasdaq delivered 11 percent organic revenue growth, double digit, in its latest quarter. That’s a nice acceleration and 21 percent earnings growth,” Cramer said. “Plus, with Nasdaq’s stock trading at less than 16 times next year’s earnings estimates, I think it’s a bargain.”CNBC’s Jim Cramer on Monday said he did not expect Lyft
shares to get hit so hard on Monday after their after a positive Friday debut on the stock market.
The rideshare app traded as high as $88 a share in its first day, but tumbled nearly 12 percent to settle at $69.01 on Monday. With a load of highly-anticipated companies planning to go public in 2019, he said it’s a sign that investors must be very careful buying red-hot initial public offerings. Those include names such as Pinterest, Uber, and Airbnb.
But there is a way to make money on the IPO frenzy without buying the new stocks, Cramer said.
“If you want to play the IPO boom without taking the immense risk of buying these stocks right out of the gate, embrace the indirect approach and buy the more consistent winners here like Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs
and Amazon

"Nasdaq would be ‘very blessed’ if US attracts 50 Chinese IPOs every year, SVP says",EST-20197:48-AM,"The recent push for all companies to be socially conscious and environmentally sustainable is a “wave” threatening to crash into U.S. markets, McCooey also said during Wednesday’s wide-ranging Q&A at East Tech West. Some companies haven’t laid the groundwork for environmental, social and corporate governance, often shortened to ESG.
“So many of these public companies have been living in kind of a — I wouldn’t say a bubble — but they haven’t really understood this wave that is about to overtake the markets,” he said.
Both ESG and data privacy are at the top of the list of concerns newly public companies are facing, said Howard Zhang, a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell, who works with pre-IPO firms.
“One thing for the founders to keep in mind,” he said during the Q&A, “with the public company status comes the responsibilities.”In an annual report released this month, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission urged Congress to add new regulations, including requiring Chinese companies to disclose any financial support from President Xi Jinping’s government.

would be “very blessed” if 50 Chinese firms listed in the U.S. every year, even though such 2019 offerings are now seen below expectations, Robert McCooey, the senior vice president of its Listing Services unit, told CNBC Wednesday.
U.S. exchanges had expected more than 40 Chinese initial public offerings (IPO) this year, but will round out the year in the “mid-30s,” McCooey said at CNBC’s East Tech West conference in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, .
Still, that puts U.S. markets in a good range, he said.
“If there were 35 to 50 Chinese companies that came to the U.S. every year from here to infinity, I think we would be very blessed,” he told CNBC’s Amanda Drury.
Uncertainty from ongoing trade negotiations has affected the overall new-issue market this year, McCooey said earlier this week, adding that a commitment to a “phase one” trade deal between the U.S. and China could remove some of that doubt in the near future.
Both Nasdaq and U.S. officials have this year said they’d like to see increased scrutiny for Chinese companies looking to list on U.S. markets. Nasdaq has reportedly begun slowing down internal processes and approvals for smaller Chinese firms preparing to list, according to Reuters in an article from late September.A key Nasdaq executive said his exchange would be “very blessed” if 50 Chinese companies hold initial public offerings in the U.S. each year.

Nasdaq plows ahead to launch bitcoin futures despite cryptocurrencies’ bear market,EST-20183:14-PM,"The Nasdaq is moving ahead with plans to launch bitcoin futures as early as next year, despite an ongoing bear market for crypto.
The world’s second-largest stock exchange is partnering with VanEck to launch cryptocurrency products, including derivatives, according to a representative from the investment management firm.
Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck’s director of digital asset strategy, confirmed previous reports of the bitcoin product during the “Consensus: Invest” conference in Manhattan on Tuesday. The companies will bring “a regulated crypto 2.0 futures-type contract” to investors, Gurbacs said during a panel discussion.
Nasdaq won’t be the only one in the bitcoin futures arena — rival New York Stock Exchange’s owner Intercontinental Exchange is rolling out its own contracts and said last week they will go live in late January.
So far, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates bitcoin, has approved two crypto futures products — one from the Chicago Board Options Exchange and another by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. This week, those derivatives contracts hit their lowest level since they were introduced in December.
VanEck’s Gurbacs said the firm “ran a few extra miles working with the CFTC to bring about new standards for custody and surveillance.”
Those are two of the issues that Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton said this week need to be resolved before he would feel “comfortable” allowing a crypto exchange traded fund, or ETF, to come to market.
TWEET
VanEck has separately been vying for approval of what would be the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The SEC has turned down multiple other applications, including one by brothers Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, citing risks of market manipulation and investor protection.
The U.S. financial watchdog has yet to approve one. It published a letter in January pointing to “significant investor protection issues that need to be examined” before sponsors can offer these funds to retail investors.
Bitcoin itself is struggling to find a bottom this week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency rose 13 percent, back above the $4,000 level after hitting a 14-month low on Sunday. Bitcoin is down more than 75 percent since its all-time high near $20,000 in December, according to data from CoinDesk.
Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told CNBC in April that the exchange was closely watching the cryptocurrency sector. Once it matures, she said, the Nasdaq is open to becoming a platform for trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.
“Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time,” Friedman told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” in April. “If we do look at it and say ‘it’s time, people are ready for a more regulated market,’ for something that provides a fair experience for investors.”

But Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, noted there are some technical signs that the “downside momentum has been broken.”
“The rally the past two weeks has produced two sessions with upside volume overwhelming downside volume by a ratio of 10-to-1 or more,” Bittles wrote in a note. “The improved breadth does not eliminate the possibility of a retest, but it suggests the magnitude of any retest could be less damaging.”

Read all of CNBC’s coronavirus coverage here.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Sunday he was cautiously optimistic that the outbreak was slowing down in the U.S. He also said parts of the country may start to reopen next month. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday the worst may be over “if we continue to be smart.”
However, Fauci added this does not mean the entire country would flip a “light switch” and go back to normal.
Confirmed cases in the U.S. now total more than 560,000, more than any other country in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. New York state accounts for more than 190,000 of those cases. The death count in the U.S. from the virus is more than 22,000.
“The various mitigation efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 seem to be working. What comes next is very much up in the air,” said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. “With the timing of the reopening of the economy now being debated and the economic effects of the engineered shutdown still to be determined, we urge investors to remain wary but watchful as events unfold.”
Chaikin noted the market’s recent rally — which led the S&P 500 to retrace half of its downside move from record highs — may set up investors for disappointment as the corporate earnings season begins.

“While some people might say we’re at the beginning of a new bull market, I think we have to take a wait-and-see attitude,” Stovall said.

“So far the fears are unfounded,” Rupkey said.
The major indexes hovered around the flatline for most of the session as companies like Exxon Mobil and Intel delivered quarterly reports that disappointed investors.
Dow member Exxon fell more than 2% after the company’s results were dragged down by poor performances in its refining and chemicals businesses. Intel, another Dow component, fell 9% after the company issued light revenue guidance for the year. The stock also posted its biggest one-day drop since 2016.
“The burden of proof is fairly high,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “Investors’ appetite for companies that either disappoint or offer lower guidance on a go-forward basis tends to be met with a pretty sharp reaction.”
Those results overshadowed stronger-than-expected numbers from companies like Amazon and Ford Motor.
Amazon shares closed 2.5% higher after results topped expectations on Thursday and Wall Street analysts trumpeted its announced push to one-day delivery for Prime members.
Ford Motor, meanwhile, jumped 10.7% — posting its biggest gain since 2009 — after issuing better-than-forecast quarterly numbers, which were driven by strong truck and SUV sales in North America.

Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group, said investors should keep riding stocks higher as downside risks are limited.
“I don’t think it’s a time to be making significant additions to equities, but at the same time there is not a lot of downside risk,” he said. “Net net, we’re advising our clients to stick with their equity positions and, if stock prices decline from current levels, that may be a buying opportunity.”

"As Nasdaq 100 hits record, Apple and Intel could still be buys, says expert",EDT-201910:06-AM,"The Nasdaq 100
just hit a record, but that doesn’t mean buying tech is off the table, one expert says.
The tech-heavy index made an all-time high Wednesday morning, helped by a 4% surge in shares of Intel
. And, according to Blue Line Futures President Bill Baruch, there’s probably even more upside for the chipmaker.
“I think Intel had the most constructive pullback to those December lows, which was a double bottom,” Baruch said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation,” pointing to the semiconductor company’s three-year chart.
“It’s come off those lows very well and, ultimately, it looks to be trying to close out above those highs from last year,” Baruch continued. “A close out above $58 is very, very bullish.”
As for Apple
, shares of which inched higher in early trading Wednesday after the iPhone maker ended a yearslong battle on Tuesday with Qualcomm over patents, Baruch said the real test will be if the stock can push above the key $200 level. Apple’s opening price on Wednesday was $199.54.
“The 50-day moving average has not crossed out above the 200 in Apple yet. There is some strong resistance at $200. It’s a big battle ground there. But the [average directional index], which shows whether a stock is trending or not, is picking up force,” he said. “I think that, ultimately, Apple has the potential to really work hand in hand with the Nasdaq in a breakout. And don’t doubt it that Apple would be the fuel that really could drive a second-half move in the Nasdaq upon a breakout and really outpace other stocks.”
Michael Binger, president of Gradient Investments, favored another big-cap tech name: Google parent Alphabet
.
Noting that he would rather wait for a pullback before buying most tech stocks, Binger said investors who need to buy at these levels should consider Alphabet for its internet advertising business and “the long runway of growth” it has.
“It’s not the cheapest stock in the world, but the growth warrants that multiple,” he said in the same “Trading Nation” interview.
Binger’s other picks? Fintech leader PayPal
and under-the-radar biotech play BioMarin
.
“I think PayPal is a great name and one of the leading companies in that space to own. It’s had an aggressive move, so any move below $100, I would step in full force,” he said.
Binger said BioMarin was on his list because it “is a biotech company that actually has revenue.”
“These revenues are growing 15% on a year-over-year basis,” he said. “They tend to spend a lot of money, but they’re doing so because they have what we consider a very interesting pipeline of new drugs that are coming on the market. So, all in all, I would look at Google, I would look at BioMarin and I would look at PayPal on a pullback in this kind of overbought space right now.”"
"‘Speed bump’ exchange gets its first stock listing, as Interactive Brokers jumps from Nasdaq",EDT-20189:17-AM,"IEX Group, the two-year-old stock exchange known for putting a “speed bump” on trading, now has its first stock listing, as Interactive Brokers announces plans to move there from Nasdaq.
The stock will begin trading on IEX on Friday, Oct. 5, under the same ticker, IBKR
.
Thomas Peterffy, Interactive Brokers’ founder and chairman, acknowledged in a statement Wednesday that being first to list on a relatively new exchange may have some risks, “but we think that individual and institutional customers who own and trade our stock will receive better execution prices and that advantage will outweigh the risk.”
IEX was founded in 2012 and officially began operating as an exchange in 2016 with a stated goal of restoring equilibrium to a fragmented system of U.S. exchanges and trading sites that had become dominated by high-speed trading. Its speed bump, a brief delay in orders to trade stocks, was designed to foil traders that use high-speed computer programs to predict incremental market moves and quickly buy and sell shares before others can.
Controversial at first, speed bumps have proliferated among U.S. market sites, though they differ from IEX’s to varying degrees.
Stock listings is another area of growth for markets. NYSE
and Nasdaq
had also come to dominate the listings business in the last decade, and IEX got approval last year to compete with them. This month, United Continental’s stock began trading on Nasdaq after moving from NYSE, the ninth such move this year.
“A new choice means more competition, better value, lower prices and better service for companies,” said IEX’s CEO and co-founder Brad Katsuyama, in a separate statement on Wednesday.
IEX said last year it would pursue companies currently listed and would eventually look to attract initial public offerings.
Shares of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of NYSE, traded down 0.2 percent in the premarket. Shares of Nasdaq were up 0.4 percent. Shares of Interactive Brokers will begin trading on IEX on Friday, Oct. 5, under the same ticker, IBKR.

Nasdaq CEO says ICOs are ‘taking advantage’ of retail investors,EDT-201812:12-PM,"Cryptocurrency fundraising has brought in billions of dollars this year, mostly from retail investors. The process known as an initial coin offering exposes those investors to serious risks, according to the CEO of Nasdaq.
“To make it no rules at all, when companies can just willy-nilly take people’s money and offer no information at all, with no governance, that sounds to me like you’re taking advantage of people,” Adena Friedman said at the Future of Fintech conference in New York Wednesday.
The victims are typically first-time investors, like “Auntie Mae in Iowa,” and have almost no access to information, she said. While the Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to provide retail investors the same information as banks or bigger investors in IPOs, this cryptocurrency process has almost no oversight.
“In ICO space none of that is available, and it’s all being bought by retail,” Friedman said. “I have real concern on lack of transparency, oversight, and accountability that these companies have as they’re going out to raise capital through an ICO.”
In an initial coin offering, or ICO, coins or tokens are put up for sale as a form of crowdfunding. Instead of voting rights or dividends that come with shares of a company, “utility tokens” promise access to a network, platform or service. But they’re often backed by an abstract idea or nothing at all.
In late May, Cayman Islands start-up Block.one had raised $4 billion, eclipsing the world’s biggest initial public offerings on stock exchanges this year while its flagship product was not even live yet.
The SEC has cracked down on ICOs, which raised $6.6 billion in 2017 and have hit $9.1 billion this year, according to research firm Autonomous Next. The financial watchdog has warned of pump-and-dump schemes in ICOs, shut some down and charged one backed by Floyd Mayweather and DJ Khalid with fraud. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has said he hasn’t seen an ICO that doesn’t classify as a security.
“I sympathize with SEC saying these are really securities offerings,” Friedman said. “I support the SEC on that.”
Friedman told CNBC in April that once regulation is smoothed out and the space “matures,” Nasdaq would consider becoming a digital-currency exchange. But for now, she said, Nasdaq is taking the partnership route.
In April, the company announced a collaboration with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by early bitcoin investors Tyler Winklevoss and Cameron Winklevoss. The deal gives Gemini access to Nasdaq’s surveillance technology to help make sure the platform provides a fair and “rules-based marketplace” for their own participants, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement.
Friedman said, “We feel more comfortable partnering with someone as opposed to becoming one of those markets — at this point because it is a completely unregulated market.”
Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin
could have a massive impact on the future of finance, Friedman said. But in the near term, “the jury’s out.”
“We have to assume this is something that could become something really interesting and a real layer of the internet,” she said. “It could also die on the vine and become the Beanie Baby phenomenon.”Initial coin offerings have serious potential to rip off retail investors, mostly due to a lack of public information, according to Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman.
“I have real concern on lack of transparency, oversight, and accountability that these companies have as they’re going out to raise capital through an ICO,” Friedman says.

Nearly 170 S&P 500 companies had reported third-quarter earnings through Tuesday morning, according to data from The Earnings Scout.

A CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University showed daily U.S. coronavirus cases have risen by an average of 69,967 over the past week, a record. The average number of Covid-19 hospitalizations has also risen by at least 5% in 36 states over the past seven days, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project.
Wall Street was coming off a tough session, with the Dow posting its biggest one-day drop since early September. The decline was sparked in part by the rising number of coronavirus cases and an inability by lawmakers to push forward on new fiscal stimulus. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned the Senate until Nov. 9, further diminishing the prospects of a deal being reached before the election.
Investors are also bracing for a potentially contested election result, which could lead to volatile trading in the markets.
“The biggest risk appears to be the threat of a contested election and the country not knowing the winner of the Presidential election next Tuesday night,” Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, told CNBC.” I think that investors are taking some chips off the table or increasing their hedging positions in advance of what could be a tenuous period for risk assets.”"

The death toll from the coronavirus has also overtaken that of the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would speed up development of drugs aimed at treating pneumonia-like viruses. Xi also said China will win the fight against the coronavirus. He noted, however, the situation remains dire.

"The Nasdaq just hit a major milestone after a record run, but one technician sees some yellow flags",EDT-20182:52-PM,"The records have been rolling in for the Nasdaq
since 2016 and the index just hit a new milestone.
When adjusted for swings in inflation over the last two decades, the Nasdaq composite is just now touching its 2000 peak, according to an analysis by LPL Research. The tech-heavy index is just 2 percent above the level reached before the dot-com bust.
While current levels have provided a measure of support, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon cautions that further highs could be difficult to attain.
“The shape of this pattern to me looks like we’re seeing a pattern of sort of this consolidation. There’s not as much urgency to the upside,” Gordon told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday, referring to a chart of the Nasdaq. “You’re going to see divergences. The rate of change is decreasing and so we’re losing upside momentum.”
The Nasdaq’s moving average convergence-divergence line fell below zero during the early February sell-off before returning to above that level on Feb. 21. A move to below zero indicates a change in momentum direction, usually a downtrend. The index’s relative strength index, a measure of overbought conditions, is high at just above 60. By comparison, the S&P 500 has an RSI of 53.
The PowerShares QQQ
, a market-weighted ETF of 100 stocks in the Nasdaq, is also showing signs of fatigue, says Gordon.
“The QQQ, this is the Nasdaq, you’re going to see that the volume has been very unhappy,” said Gordon. “We’re not seeing a lot of volume on the topside here in the Nasdaq here.”
Volume in the QQQ has generally been in decline since the beginning of the month. The measure hit the year’s high of 118.54 million shares traded on Feb. 6 and ended Thursday’s session at 28.81 million. Volume started March at 76.81 million.
The Nasdaq’s long-term fundamentals picture looks sunnier to Michael Bapis, partner and managing director at the Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors.
“The difference between now and 2000, 2001, all these companies are making money,” Bapis said on “Trading Nation.” “Most of these companies have a P/E that’s a reasonable P/E, aside from some of the crazy trading names like Netflix
.”
The Nasdaq trades at around 22 times forward earnings, while major components such as Apple
, Alphabet
, Facebook
and Microsoft
all trade at a multiple under 30.
“Apple, Amazon, a lot of those companies, they’re going to continue to make money,” said Bapis. “Long term it’s going to be higher.”
But, the headwinds coming for tech and broader markets are going to be difficult to navigate, Gordon said.
“The credit quality, this move up in interest rates, this loss of a four-decade uptrend in bonds, downtrend in yields, that’s the source of the volatility which I think far surpasses these amazing developments technology has come across in the last couple of decades,” said Gordon. “That’s going to be the key that we’re going to watch.”
Bapis predicts that this time next year the Nasdaq will be higher, but warns that it will likely be “choppy and volatile along the way.”
The Nasdaq hit a record high Monday and is up 3 percent in March. Its 8 percent year-to-date gain makes it the best-performing benchmark index of 2018."
"This beaten-up group must rebound before Nasdaq can recover, investor Paul Meeks says ",EST-201810:03-AM,"Longtime investor Paul Meeks believes it could take months until the Nasdaq
stages a sustainable comeback.
Meeks, who ran the world’s biggest tech fund for Merrill Lynch during the dot-com boom and subsequent collapse, predicts the correction gripping the tech-heavy index will only get deeper due a particularly hard-hit group of stocks, which doesn’t include the FANG names.
“Semiconductors, being such an important part of the tech sector, impacts the whole shebang. I actually think it’s the biggest tell,” he said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “Right now, we’re in the midst of what we call an inventory correction. That means there are not only too many chips at the vendors themselves, but at their customers.”
The semis began selling off this year before the Nasdaq. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF
is down 11 percent over the past six months.
“I have an extra-large cash position right now,” he said. “I am keeping powder dry. I’m not convinced that we’re near the bottom in these [semi] names.”
According to Meeks, investors will likely have to wait into the new year for more clarity on the chip glut.
“We’ve already been through quarterly results for these companies,” Meeks said. “So, we can’t see the inventory line on these balance sheets for another maybe 90 days.”
Until he gets more guidance from semis, Meeks suggests he’ll be staying mostly on the sidelines. He estimates that the Nasdaq sell-off is in its sixth or seventh inning.
“I don’t think that we’ll see a recovery before the end of 2018,” he said.
His forecast may sound discouraging, but Meeks is confident tech will stage a strong rebound next year.
“You could have some semiconductor stocks go up double and triple from where they are trading now,” Meeks said. “The biggest call in technology will be the semiconductor turn. The people who get that right in 2019 are going to make a load of money.”"

Tuesday’s continued bounce comes after a Reuters report said China’s central bank could cut its key lending rate as well as banks’ reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) in the coming weeks to support economic growth. The report came a day after the People’s Bank of China unveiled liquidity injection measures to the tune of more than 1 trillion yuan. The PBOC also injected another 400 billion yuan in liquidity. 
“The balance between deleveraging and growth is likely to be tilted towards stimulus in order to make up ground lost due to the virus and quarantine,” said Larry Brainard, chairman for emerging markets at TS Lombard, in a note. “With Q1/20 GDP likely to fall sharply, we expect Beijing to respond aggressively with fiscal and monetary stimulus to get growth on track in Q2/20. This will generate a V-shaped recovery, led by the industrial sector.”
Chinese stocks jumped sharply overnight after a massive slump on Monday. The Shanghai Composite closed 1.3% higher while the Shenzhen A Shares index gained 1.8%. Other equity indexes in the region, including Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and the Korean Kospi, also posted strong gains.
That positive sentiment spilled over into European equity markets. The Stoxx 600 index gained 1.6%. Meanwhile, the German Dax climbed 1.8% along with the French CAC 40.
Markets were higher despite a climbing death toll from the coronavirus and despite disappointing earnings from Alphabet after the bell Monday.
As of Monday night, the virus death toll had reached 426 with 20,679 confirmed cases in China. Yet, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic on Monday said his outlook for the U.S. economy was unmoved by the virus. White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also doesn’t think the outbreak is not a “disaster for the U.S. economy.
“The fear last week was that the outbreak was happening at a time when the economic data was shaky at best,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. He noted a dismal Chicago PMI release on Friday soured investor sentiment. However, the data released this week — including manufacturing activity and factory orders — show signs of stabilization.

Tesla, meanwhile, powered the Nasdaq with a surge of more than 13% that lifted the stock above $900 for the first time. That rally follows Tesla’s best day in six years. Billionaire investor Ron Baron, a longtime Tesla bull, said Tuesday that Tesla could see revenues of $1 trillion in 10 years. Tesla, however, gave back a chunk of its gains in the final minutes of trading. At its high of the day, Tesla had surged more than 24%.

About a quarter of S&P 500 companies had reported second-quarter earnings through Wednesday’s open. Of those companies, 78% have posted a better-than-expected profit, according to FactSet data.
Wall Street also kept a close eye on big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet as they faced mounting regulatory pressure. Facebook and Amazon initially dropped after the Justice Department announced a broad antitrust review of big tech companies. The two stocks recovered to trade slightly higher.
“We think that a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,” said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, in a note. “We believe that Congress and the DOJ will investigate claims of anticompetitive behavior, but ultimately, we expect a ‘no harm, no foul’ outcome. We continue to be bullish on the likes of Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon and would be buyers of these names at current valuation.”

Analysts urge caution as stocks on Shanghai’s new Nasdaq-style tech board surge,EDT-20191:50-AM,"Prior to their public debut, initial public offerings on the STAR Market saw an average over-subscription of about 1,700 times among retail investors, Reuters reported. In the first five days of a company’s listing, no daily price limits will be placed. But after that period, a stock will be allowed to trade within a 20% range.
In comparison, listings elsewhere in China are subjected to a gain cap of 44% on their debut and limited to a 10% gain or loss thereafter.
J.P. Morgan’s Chief China Economist and Head of China Equity Strategy, Haibin Zhu, urged investors to “focus on individual companies.”
“You need to focus on the sector and the company itself, and make sure that they have decent or stable earnings outlook,” Zhu told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on Monday.

“For anything new in China, there is a tendency for retail-oriented markets like China to overly speculate,” Qian said, adding that this would contribute to a “short-term bubble” that may not be sustainable.
The new technology board — the Science and Technology Innovation Board, or “STAR Market,” which is operated by the Shanghai Stock Exchange — comes as China attempts to address investor concerns about market volatility and the lack of governance.
It’s easier for firms to go public in the new STAR Market tech board, compared to listing on the Shanghai A-share market, as companies need to go through a registration instead of waiting for regulatory approval which could take longer.

"Nasdaq is open to becoming cryptocurrency exchange, CEO says",EDT-20181:33-PM,"“ICOs need to be regulated,” she said. “The SEC is right that those are securities and need to be regulated as such.”
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has cracked down on ICO fraud in 2018, and said in March it is looking to apply securities laws to everything from cryptocurrency exchanges to digital asset storage companies known as wallets. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the watchdog is devoting a “significant portion of resources” to the ICO market.
The more than 1,300 percent rise of bitcoin prices last year certainly caught the attention of regulators. Bitcoin
neared $20,000 in December before having its worst first quarter in history, dropping 48 percent in the first three months of this year. The cryptocurrency has recovered above $9,000 this week, and hit a high of $9,746.82 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. The digital currency is up roughly 20 percent this week.Once the space matures, Nasdaq is open to becoming a platform for trading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin
, according to the company’s CEO.
“Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time,” Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told CNBC’s Squawk Box Wednesday. “If we do look at it and say ‘it’s time, people are ready for a more regulated market,’ for something that provides a fair experience for investors.”
A key roadblock for the Nasdaq
and other institutional investors is regulation, which Friedman said needs to be ironed out before the company would add an exchange. But she was bullish on the future of digital assets.
“I believe that digital currencies will continue to persist it’s just a matter of how long it will take for that space to mature,” Friedman said. “Once you look at it and say, ‘do we want to provide a regulated market for this?’ Certainly Nasdaq would consider it.”
In the meantime, the Nasdaq is supporting existing cryptoexchanges.
On Wednesday, the company announced a collaboration with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by early bitcoin investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The deal gives Gemini access to Nasdaq’s surveillance technology to help make sure the platform provides a fair and “rules-based marketplace,” for their own participants, Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement.
While Friedman was optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies she was less so on the fundraising process known as an initial coin offering, or ICO.Once the regulation is smoothed out and the space “matures”, Nasdaq would consider becoming a digital currency exchange, the company’s CEO says.

‘This isn’t even a tech index’: Ex-NYSE President Tom Farley throws shade at the Nasdaq,EDT-201811:35-AM,"Former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley told CNBC on Monday that he isn’t so sure his old rival, the Nasdaq

“This isn’t even a tech index,” he contended on “Squawk Box” from the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York’s Times Square. “I mean, Bed Bath & Beyond
? Why are they acting like this is a tech index? It was free branding for my competitor.”
Farley did admit, “It felt a little weird walking into this building this morning,” referring to the Nasdaq MarketSite, where the “Squawk Box” studio is located. Farley is now chairman and CEO of Far Point Acquisition, a blank-check company he helped form with Dan Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point.
The NYSE — one of the largest equities-based exchanges in the world — trades billions of shares each day for thousands of companies, including some tech names including Twitter
and Alibaba
.
But the Nasdaq is home to the biggest U.S. tech giants: Apple
, Amazon
, Microsoft
and Google parent Alphabet
.
Farley, who ran the NYSE from November 2013 to May 2018, characterized the rivalry between the two exchanges to that of the Hatfields and McCoys, the two mountain clans on the West Virginia–Kentucky border who waged a bitter feud in the late 1800s.
“The Hatfields and McCoys competition really, truly did benefit the listing companies,” the businesses holding initial public offerings or IPOs, said Farley, who added he has “tremendous” respect for the Nasdaq and the people who run it.
However, he said, “I woke up everyday trying to kill them.”
Still, the NYSE has opened up more to other exchanges. Earlier this year, The NYSE ended a decades-old restriction that prevented stocks listed on rival exchanges, including the Nasdaq, from being bought and sold on its trading floor.Tom Farley says he isn’t so sure his former rival, the Nasdaq, should be considered a benchmark for tech stocks.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq close higher as tech leads broad market gains,EDT-20204:32-PM,"Bank stocks struggled, however, with Citigroup falling 0.9%. JPMorgan Chase dropped more than 3% and Bank of America closed 1.8% lower. Goldman Sachs ended the day down 1.7%. The losses in JPMorgan and Goldman weighed on the Dow. 
The broader market also got a boost after China reported its first retail sales increase for the year. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said Chinese retail sales rose 0.5% in August. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher on Tuesday. 
This puts China “on track to return to its pre-virus growth rate before the end of the year,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. “Retail sales surpassed 2019 levels for the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak, while investment and output growth continued to strengthen” last month. 
In the U.S., the Empire State Manufacturing index came in at 17 for September, rebounding from a print of 3.7 in August. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the index to come in at 7.
Tuesday’s gains came after a the major averages popped more than 1% on Monday, boosted by a slew of dealmaking activity and a rally in tech stocks. Hopes around a potential coronavirus vaccine also lifted sentiment on Monday. 
“Regardless of the situation, regardless of the sector, big commitments and big mergers tend to show confidence, and we would take those as positive signs,” said Jeff Buchbinder, an equity strategist at LPL Financial.
Traders also looked ahead to the Federal Reserve concluding its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Stocks rose on Tuesday, building on the strong performance from the previous session, on the back of broad market gains and solid economic data.
The S&P 500
gained 0.5% to close at 3,401.20 and the Nasdaq Composite
advanced 1.2% to 11,190.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
 closed just above the flatline at 27,995.60 after rising as much as 237 points. 
Microsoft jumped 1.6%. Amazon and Alphabet each rose 1.7%. Netflix gained 4.1% and Facebook closed higher by 2.4%. Tesla shares, meanwhile, popped 7.2% after surging more than 12% on Monday. Tuesday marked the second straight solid performance for Big Tech after the group’s sharp sell-off last week, which pressured the broader market.
Other parts of the market participated in Tuesday’s move higher. The S&P 500 real estate and utilities sectors were up 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively. Materials, industrials and health care were also higher.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is showing signs of ‘deterioration’ beneath the surface,EST-20177:46-AM,"The Nasdaq composite has begun showing clear signs of weakness, according to a strategist who sees trouble ahead for high-flying growth stocks.

The Nasdaq on Thursday posted its largest single-day drop in over two weeks. Larry McDonald, founder of the Bear Traps Report, said cracks beneath the surface of the tech-heavy index are signaling further downside, particularly after a historically strong year for growth stocks and the broader market. Here’s why:
The number of stocks hitting 52-week highs in the Nasdaq, as well as on the New York Stock Exchange, has been “deteriorating pretty rapidly,” he said.
“Fewer stocks are maintaining their highs, and more specifically, fewer and fewer stocks are holding up the market. So the overall breadth has been deteriorating even as the market and the Nasdaq have been making new highs,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” In referring to the index’s breadth, McDonald pointed to the number of stocks advancing relative to the number declining.
The credit market, particularly in high yield, has seen a “sharp deterioration” relative to the Nasdaq most of this week and last, McDonald said. Specifically, one high-yield exchange-traded fund often seen as a leading market indicator, the HYG
, has sharply diverged from the S&P 500 in recent days, perhaps signaling trouble for the market overall.
At this juncture, investors ought to think about moving into value, he said. “We’ve been recommending clients sell the Nasdaq, sell their Nasdaq 100 exposure, and move toward value,” McDonald said. “Because value has been underperforming for about 18 months, especially over the last year, and we believe there will be a rotation back to value in 2018,” he said.
Bottom line... McDonald says a bevy of technical and fundamental signs are pointing to trouble ahead for the tech-heavy Nasdaq, and he recommends investors begin moving into value names instead."
"Nasdaq crosses 9,000, Dow and S&P 500 notch new highs as year-end rally rolls on",EST-20194:44-PM,"Stocks climbed Thursday, hitting record highs as the market rallied into the end of 2019.

Amazon led the gains, jumping more than 4% after the e-commerce giant said the holiday shopping season broke all records. Trading volumes remained thin this week.
The S&P 500 notched its 34th record close Thursday. The benchmark has risen 3.1% this month and 8.8% this quarter, bringing the year-to-date gains to 29.2%. The S&P 500 has a good chance at scoring a historic year: It is now less than 1 percentage point from posting the best annual performance since 1997.
“Stocks look like they just wont quit. The rally is for real,” Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note Thursday. “The economy’s engines continue to hum.”
U.S. weekly jobless claims decreased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Dec. 21, the Labor Department said Thursday. The number is slightly higher than estimates of 220,000 in a Dow Jones poll of economists.
Markets in Europe, Australia and Hong Kong remained closed Thursday for the holiday. Trading volumes were muted in the U.S. with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) trading about 24 million shares Thursday, well below its 30-day volume average of 60 million shares.
In a shortened Christmas Eve session Tuesday, the S&P 500 finished flat and Nasdaq rose to another record. The tech-heavy index also posted its ninth consecutive record close for the first time since 1998.
Investors have been adding more risk after the U.S. and China announced they have reached a phase one trade agreement earlier this month. The two countries are in the process of translating the deal, aiming to sign it in early January.
In a regular press briefing on Thursday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said China is in close touch with the U.S. on signing the initial trade pact. President Donald Trump said Tuesday the deal is “getting done,” adding there will be a signing ceremony with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Stocks typically get a boost this time of the year during the so-called Santa Claus rally period. In the final five trading days of the year and the first two tradings days of the new year, the S&P 500 has posted a 1.3% gain on average since 1950, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac.

As of June 1, the sector had reported 25.8 percent year-on-year earnings growth for the first quarter, according to CFRA.
“In contrast to the S&P, the Nasdaq’s new closing high reinforces the case that equities markets are incrementally improving/strengthening not weakening,” Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, wrote in an email to CNBC. “A progression of intermediate-term, multi-month correction lows are developing across most groups with Technology one of the first sectors to bottom and continue lead to the upside. Incrementally, most other sectors are following.”
Echoing the optimistic views on technology, Frank Cappelleri of Instinet told CNBC that seeing the Nasdaq approach its highest shows that the long-term uptrend remains intact.

Op-Ed: The Nasdaq is due for a correction,EDT-201711:37-PM,"The chart has two analysis features. The first feature is the long term uptrend trading channel (A). A trading channel is created by two parallel sloping trend lines. The lower trend line starts from the Nasdaq low in March 2009. The trend line placement is confirmed by successful rebound tests in 2011, and in 2,016 February. Trend line (B) starts in April, 2010. This trend line was broken on the upside in December, 2013. After then, the trend line acted as a support level. The Nasdaq clustered around the upper trend line until January, 2016. The Nasdaq dipped below the upper trend line for five months in 2016, but in July of that year the index moved above the upper trend line.
The Nasdaq has moved well above trend line B, so this is now a long-term support level. This is a very strong bullish trend signal, but it also opens the potential for a pullback and correction.
The second Nasdaq analysis feature is the construction of trading bands. Trading bands are horizontal support and resistance levels. The lowest trading band was created and confirmed between February, 2010 and February, 2012. The width of this trading band was projected upwards to give the first breakout target. When this was achieved, the width of the trading band was used to set the next upside target. This method has successfully set all the Nasdaq breakout targets since 2012, including the most recent 6,310 target level.
Using this analysis method, the most recent trading band target was 6,310. This level was reached in June this year. The width of the trading band is projected upwards and gives the next target near 6,820.
The monthly chart provides strategic analysis. The trading channel defines how the Nasdaq uptrend develops. Investors expect to see the index retreat clustering near the value of the most recent trading band support near 5,780. This confirms that when the index retreats it is a good buying opportunity for a continuation of the long-term uptrend.
The trade band analysis provides an answer to the question of how high the Nasdaq might rise. The analysis method sets a target near 6,310. In this type of market environment, we use the ANTSYSS trade method to extract good returns from the consolidation and breakout developments.

is due for a correction.
It has soared above the primary uptrend line and achieved the trade band target of 6,310. A correction is a high probability and trade band analysis is used to set the downside targets.

"Nasdaq dips into bear market territory briefly Thursday as investors bail on Apple, Amazon",EST-20184:04-PM,"The Nasdaq Composite
entered bear market territory Thursday as Wall Street sold off pricey technology stocks amid steep valuations, increased regulatory concerns and fears of slowing economic growth.
The tech-heavy benchmark lost nearly 3 percent at its low of the day, bringing its losses to more than 20 percent from a record reached at the end of August. It finished the day just under that level, down 1.6 percent for the day and 19.7 percent from its record.
Amazon
, Apple
, Netflix
and Alphabet
, which drove the gains in the Nasdaq during the bull market, were all lower on Thursday. Those names are all already in bear market territory individually, down more than 20 percent from highs.
Apple is down 32 percent from its latest high. Amazon is off by 29 percent from its record. At their peaks, both were worth more than $1 trillion in market value. On Thursday, both lost more than 2 percent.
Even Microsoft
, which had held up better than other big tech recently, was getting hit on Thursday. The stock was down 2 percent, bringing its decline from its 52-week high to 12 percent.
“It’s been a bear market for a little while now, whether it’s been reflected in Russell 2000 or the Nasdaq,” said Steven DeSanctis, a Jefferies equity strategist. “We’ve seen sectors like energy, financials and some consumer names that have been absolutely beaten up. It’s pretty broad-based.”
Investors were quick to abandon the tech household names in part thanks to how expensive technology stocks had become over the past year. Traders bought up such stocks throughout 2017 and into 2018 amid a swell in demand for chips and an acceleration in revenues at Facebook and Amazon that promised companies some of the best advertising exposure available.
But an uptick in borrowing costs and heightened regulatory scrutiny has trimmed the buoyant income outlook for the sector, which often borrows cash to fuel innovation or content purchasing. Facebook stock, for instance, fell more than 30 percent over the past six months as a string of data privacy reports and subsequent federal hearings threw the social media giant into the limelight. Facebook actually finished Thursday higher, but is down 38 percent from its 52-week high.
“People are really worried about 2019 outlook and what earnings numbers are going to be,” DeSanctis added. “Earnings numbers are coming down for 2019. Companies are able to manage around higher interest rates, which slow down their business, but the tariffs add an additional cost. So companies are really going to take a step back and not spend a lot of money initially in 2019.”
Apple
also faced revenue concerns this quarter after it told investors that it will no longer disclose iPhone unit sales when it reports financial results, raising fears that sales of the iconic smartphone may have peaked. Many analysts and shareholders, who had used the quarterly phone sales figures as a quick gauge of the company’s income health, said they were disappointed with Apple’s choice to withhold the information.
Chipmakers saw their equity soar in 2017 as retail investors flocked to cryptocurrency investments and developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous driving promised long-lasting demand for semiconductors and equipment.

Trade war hasn’t stopped Chinese companies from listing in the US: Nasdaq,EST-201811:49-PM,"“I’m not going to say that we’ll do well over 180 next year. But it feels like, both from here as well as domestically, that the IPO market will continue to be very, very strong. The trade tensions, trade war will find a resolution. Whether in the short term or medium term, there will be one,” he said.
Globally, the total value of IPOs rose 5 percent year-on-year to $219.4 billion in 2018, according to Baker McKenzie. But the number of IPOs fell 17 percent from last year to 1,448 deals in 2018, the law firm said.
The global IPO market has been supported by Chinese companies raising funds outside their home country, said Baker McKenzie.
“Companies are no longer bound by geography when looking at where to list, but gravitate to venues that meet their overall objectives,” Ashok Lalwani, Asia Pacific head of international capital markets practice at Baker McKenzie, said in a report earlier this month.
“It is not so much a question of why one market is unattractive but rather why another fits the bill better. The US has been the hub of innovation, though China is making strides, and has the support that tech listings need to succeed post listing, including excellent research coverage,” he added.Tensions between Washington and Beijing may have dominated business headlines throughout the year, but that did not stop Chinese companies from flocking to the U.S. to list on stocks exchanges there.
In fact, there were more Chinese initial public offerings in the U.S. this year compared to 2017. 
There were 37 IPOs by Chinese companies in the U.S. this year, raising a total of $9.2 billion, according to data by law firm Baker McKenzie. That’s an increase from last year’s 20 IPOs that raised $3.6 billion, the statistics showed.
Nasdaq, which attracted several large initial public offerings by Chinese companies this year, said it is still “rigorously” luring Asian firms to list on its exchange.
“There are small groups of companies who will decide to list somewhere else besides the local markets here in Asia, and we vigorously pursue them and believe that they belong on Nasdaq,” Bob McCooey, Nasdaq’s Asia Pacific chairman, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.
Nasdaq has had more than 180 IPOs this year, an increase from 136 in 2017, according to McCooey. Among the new listings on Nasdaq this year are Chinese video streaming company iQiyi
’s $2.3 billion offering and Chinese e-commerce company Pinduoduo
’s $1.6 billion listing.
McCooey said he hasn’t heard of companies delaying IPO plans because of the trade war, partly because many Chinese firms that list in the U.S. are not within the direct line of fire in the tariff fight between the world’s two largest economies.
He added that he doesn’t think tensions between the U.S. and China would derail listing momentum in the U.S.Tensions between Washington and Beijing have not stopped Chinese companies from flocking to the U.S. in greater numbers to list on stocks exchanges there.

Wall Street has reached the tail end of the latest corporate earnings season. Nearly 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have released their calendar second-quarter results. Of those companies, 76.36 percent have reported better-than-forecast quarterly profits, according to FactSet.
Amazon and Apple are among the companies that have reported better-than-expected earnings. CVS Health also posted better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday, sending its shares up by 4.2 percent.
There have been some notable disappointments this season, however. Facebook shares lost about a fifth of their value after releasing its quarterly figures. Most recently, Disney shares dropped more than 2 percent Wednesday after the media giant posted weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue.
The S&P 500 closed Wednesday’s session just half a percent from a record high. If the index breaks above 2,872.87, it would notch its first all-time high since Jan. 26. The Nasdaq was also less than 1 percent away from a record while the Dow remained 3.9 percent below its all-time high through Tuesday’s close.
“What the market is telling you, and I concur, is a 24 percent increase in earnings and a 9 percent gain in revenue is more impactful than these tariffs,” said Mark Esposito, CEO of Esposito Securities. “That’s why we’re [near] an all-time highs.”The Nasdaq Composite
closed marginally higher on Wednesday, notching its longest winning streak since March, as shares of Facebook and Amazon rose.
The tech-heavy index gained less than 0.1 percent to close at 7,888.33, but posted its seventh consecutive gain. That is the Nasdaq’s first seven-day winning streak since the one that ended on March 12.

“Most of these companies have already done their structures … to do an offshore listing,” he added.A so-called “phase one” trade deal between the U.S. and China should be enough to remove the uncertainty that’s overshadowed initial public offerings this year, said Robert McCooey, the chairman of Nasdaq Asia-Pacific.
While there is still widespread interest from Chinese companies to list in the U.S., the uncertainty surrounding the protracted trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies has affected public listings this year.
“Investors are worried about China, they are worried about the ripple effects of the trade war,″ McCooey said at the CNBC’s East Tech West conference in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, China on Monday.
In May, McCooey said he expected over 40 initial public offerings from China in the U.S. in 2019.
On Monday, CNBC’s Nancy Hungerford asked if that target would be met. He replied: “We will probably get to close to 35 to 38 again this year.”
The two sides are currently negotiating a “phase one” deal and there are growing hopes that the partial deal will be agreed. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on the weekend that both sides had “constructive discussions” about “each other’s core concerns.”
However, it’s not expected to cover more sensitive structural issues that have plagued negotiations for months.
“So therefore some of the valuations haven’t really come in exactly where the companies would have wanted and I think they were waiting for there to be some more certainty,” McCooey added.“Investors are worried about China, they are worried about the ripple effects of the trade war,” Robert McCooey, the chairman of Nasdaq Asia-Pacific, said at the CNBC’s East Tech West conference on Monday.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq inch higher to record highs with Disney pacing gains,EST-20194:08-PM,"—CNBC’s Silvia Amaro contributed to this report.Trump told the Economic Club of New York that China wants to make a trade deal, but offered little details on how negotiations were progressing. He also blasted previous U.S. leaders for letting China “cheat” on trade.
An improving tone around U.S.-China trade relations has contributed to the market’s record run. The Dow and S&P 500 are both up more than 3% over the past month while the Nasdaq has risen 5.3% in that time.
“What makes prospects for the latest putative pact look brighter this time around is the narrower scope of the negotiations,” Eleanor Olcott, China policy analyst at TS Lombard, said in a note. “By phasing the talks and leaving thornier issues for later, a temporary plaster can be put on the increasingly fractured relationship.”
Last month, Trump said China and the U.S. agreed to a phase one trade deal to be signed later in November, raising expectations of a deal being made. However, he also said Friday he had not agreed to scrap tariffs on Chinese goods after reports earlier last week said both sides had agreed to cancel existing tariffs in tranches.
But Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, thinks a lot of the positive news around a phase one deal have been baked in.
“The stocks most exposed to the China trade war are back to prior peaks – and pre-trade war/1Q18 levels – in terms of both performance and valuation,” Calvasina said in a note. “With [earnings] reporting season winding down, a positive outcome on a China trade deal baked in, 2020 forecasts still in need of downward adjustment, and companies making it clear that 2020 guidance isn’t going to come anytime soon, positive catalysts between now and year-end are difficult to imagine.”Wall Street continued its run to record highs on Tuesday, led by strong gains in Disney and Facebook shares.
The market was slightly higher amid remarks from President Donald Trump, who hinted at Chinese enthusiasm for a trade deal, while knocking them for cheating the U.S. in past agreements.
The S&P 500

This is one of the busiest week of the corporate earnings season. Once the dust settles, more than 140 S&P 500 companies will have released their calendar first-quarter results.

“Among the key companies that have reported, most of them have beaten expectations,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “That means we’re probably going to escape an earnings recession. That will be key for the market to rally from here.”
Wall Street also kept an eye on oil prices as they hit their highest level this year amid intensifying concern about global supplies. It comes after the U.S. announced a further clampdown on Iran’s oil exports.

Tuesday’s move toward an all-time closing high comes less than six months after a sharp decline in late December, which led the S&P 500 to its worst annual performance since 2008. But stocks quickly turned around as the Federal Reserve reversed course on monetary policy while the tone around U.S.-China trade talks improved.
“These market levels are justified,” said Kevin Barry, chief investment officer at Captrust Advisors. “The fourth-quarter sell-off actually prevented a recession because policymakers responded extremely quickly. Both President Xi and President Trump cooled off the rhetoric and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell came out and reversed course.”

This under-the-radar fund tracking the fastest-growing companies has doubled the Nasdaq’s return,EDT-20207:31-AM,"(This story is for CNBC Pro subscribers only.)
Growth stocks have led the way by a long shot this year as investors flock to companies with internal strength to overcome the unprecedented uncertainty from the coronavirus. The pandemic also accelerated many technological and societal trends that benefit growth names. 
One under-the-radar mutual fund — the Sparrow Growth Fund (SGNFX)
 — is leaving its peers in the dust, soaring more than 51% this year. That’s double the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite’s 23% return. "
"The charts are pointing to more trouble for the Nasdaq 100, according to one trader",EDT-201810:33-AM,"The market’s troubles are far from over, according to one chart watcher.
Stocks opened higher on Friday after what’s been a tumultuous couple of weeks for the markets. Despite the reprieve, Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com says investors are not out of the woods just yet.
“We’ve seen a bounce, it’s been OK, but we’re starting to see some forces that cause the volatility [to] emerge,” he said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” Gordon believes many of the global forces that drove the latest sell-off — the plunge in Asian markets, threats of tariffs and rising interest rates — will continue to hit U.S. stocks.
To bet on a further drop for the Nasdaq 100, Gordon observes that an uptrend in the Nasdaq 100-tracking ETF (QQQ) from 2016 is almost broken, with the Nasdaq at one point diving below the supporting trend. The trader believes that the QQQ could actually go back and retest the line.
On an even shorter-term chart of the QQQ, Gordon notes that the ETF has actually come off its highs near $178 and fell below the trend line on Thursday. He says this suggests that the QQQ could actually reverse and retest its lows from the previous week.
As a result, Gordon wants to buy the November monthly 173-strike puts and sell the November monthly 169-strike puts for $1.09, or a cost of $109 per options spread. This means that if QQQ closes above $173 on the Nov. 16 expiration, then Gordon would lose the $109 he paid for the trade.
The Nasdaq 100 rallied along with the rest of the market indexes at Friday’s open, with the QQQ climbing almost 1 percent."
"Nasdaq closes lower for fourth straight day, S&P 500 hangs on to slight gain",EST-20184:25-PM,"The major averages gave up sharp gains on Wednesday after a summary from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting sent the benchmark 10-year U.S. note yield to its highest level in four years. The Dow closed 166 points lower, having risen as much as 303 points. On Thursday, the 10-year yield traded off its four-year high at 2.921 percent.
“The minutes convey a clear sense that inflation is more on their minds than the FOMC statement indicated,” Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, said in a note. “The minutes gave readers conviction that only a sea change will stay the Fed from four 25bp rate rises in 2018. One might think this trajectory puts the Fed behind economic activity, but market odds-setters still very much lag the Fed, pricing in only about a 25% chance of four hikes this year.”
Investors got more news out of the Fed on Thursday. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said things continue to “look up” for the U.S. economy. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, meanwhile, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that too many rate hikes could slow down the economy too much. New York Fed President William Dudley delivered prepared remarks, but did not address monetary policy.
Earlier this month, stocks suffered their first 10 percent pullback since early 2016. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed in correction territory on Feb. 8. The move lower was sparked, in part, by fears of rising inflation and higher interest rates.
“If interest rates move higher slowly, ... then I think the market will be calm,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. “But if they go up quickly, we could see another wild ride” in the market.
But the major averages were quick to recover some of those losses. As of Wednesday’s close, the Nasdaq had regained about 62 percent of the losses suffered, while the S&P 500 and Dow had jumped about 40 percent and 35 percent.
But Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said he thinks the market may have recovered a little too fast from its lows. “When you recover that fast, that usually opens the door for another downturn,” he said.
In corporate news, Chesapeake Energy shares jumped 21.7 percent after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. The stock was also the best performer in the S&P 500.
Meanwhile, Roku’s stock shed 17.7 percent after the streaming company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter.

Meanwhile, the ended Thursday’s session 0.1 percent higher at 2,703.96 after a rollover in the final hour of trading. The broad index gained as much as 1.1 percent.
“On balance, equities are in a ‘muddle-along’ zone,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “The macro economic environment still looks favorable,” but “we need another round of economic releases to get a better sense of how much inflation is in the marketplace.”The Nasdaq posted its longest losing streak since November 2016 on Thursday.

Ross noted the deal includes a $1 billion penalty against ZTE and a U.S.-chosen compliance team to be embedded at ZTE.
However, trade concerns lingered as Boeing shares dropped 1.4 percent. Boeing is highly sensitive to trade worries since a large chunk of its business comes from overseas.
Meanwhile, investors loaded up on bonds after a sharp sell-off in emerging markets, led by Brazil. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ) fell 5.1 percent. Peter Donisanu, a strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said the fall was triggered by capital flows concerns.
“The Brazilian real is getting crushed and now with the Brazilian central bank stepping in [by issuing currency swaps], that is spooking investors,” he said.
The benchmark 10-year note yield fell to 2.93 percent from around 2.97 percent on Wednesday.
Thursday’s decline comes after a strong day for Wall Street. On Wednesday, the Dow closed 346.41 points higher, supported by bank stocks that surged on higher interest rates amid expectations of an end to easy money in Europe. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday, marking its strongest gain since March 26.
Equities have rebounded over the past month, with the major indexes rising at least 3 percent in that time period. Strong economic data, coupled with tech’s sharp rise, have helped push stocks higher.

I mean, if we’re in the sixth inning, we have our sluggers coming to bat right now,” Buffett told CNBC’s Becky Quick in an exclusive interview.
“I’m no good at predicting out two or three or five years from now, although I will say this: There’s no question in my mind that America’s going to be far ahead of where we are now 10, 20 and 30 years from now,” he said.The Dow Jones industrial average

Mad Money Twitter - Jim Cramer Twitter - Facebook - Instagram - Vine
Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comCramer reiterated that Monday’s widespread strength in the stock market wouldn’t have happened without FANG. The tech giant’s stocks still helped; it’s just that others reclaimed the spotlight.
“Here’s the bottom line: the Nasdaq was left for dead not that long ago, but turns out it was just resting,” he concluded. “Will it continue to roar? I think investors like these stocks the same way Willie Sutton liked to rob banks: because that’s where the money is.”Shares of Microsoft
also helped take the Nasdaq to new highs after the company announced it would acquire GitHub, a code-building and management platform for software developers.
Microsoft’s stock reached a 52-week high on Monday, settling at $101.67 per share. Cramer applauded the company’s broad-based strength in personal computers, gaming and the cloud, commending CEO Satya Nadella for his savvy dealmaking.
“Microsoft has run, but I don’t get the sense that it’s overheating,” the “Mad Money” host said. “We have an absence of news right now and absence is making the heart grow fonder for the stock.”Cramer took note of investors’ changing sentiments about the semiconductor space as shares of Nvidia
, which makes chips for the data center, artificial intelligence, driverless car, machine learning and video game industries, reached an all-time high.
Chipmakers’ stocks had been under pressure since tensions with Chinese regulators stalled acquisition talks between Qualcomm
and NXP Semiconductors
.
“It took a little bit, but ultimately, the market was able to draw a distinction between chip companies that are pure cellphone plays and the ones that aren’t,” Cramer explained. ”[Nvidia’s] last quarter was spectacular, even if the sourpusses on Wall Street sold it off because the irrelevant cryptocurrency biz was soft. Sure didn’t take long for the stock to bounce back.”First, Cramer turned to Apple
, one of his favorite consumer products companies. Shares of the iPhone maker hit record highs on Monday as its annual developer conference kicked off.
Apple has long been the target of critics on Wall Street who worried about declining hype around the newest iPhones, supply chain issues and the like.
“But what these critics were missing is that Apple doesn’t just have the most loved, best tech for its cellphones, it’s got a razor-razorblade business model that can’t be beaten,” Cramer said. “That means people buy the phone and pay for services directly from Apple or buy some of the developer apps on display today at the big conference and Apple gets a cut of each one.”
With a growing revenue stream and a massive cloud backup service that customers don’t seem to mind paying for, Apple was a key factor in Monday’s rally, Cramer argued.
“Apple’s strength — the stock hit its all-time high again today — is exhibit A in the non-FANG romp,” he said. “It’s kind of amazing that a company with a $943 billion market cap could really rally this hard.”CNBC’s Jim Cramer knows all too well that the market can’t be driven solely by FANG, his ubiquitous acronym for the stocks of Facebook
, Amazon
, Netflix
and Google, now Alphabet
.
“On a great day for the bulls where the Dow
gained 178 points, the advanced 0.45 percent, and the Nasdaq
climbed 0.69 percent to a new all-time high, I think we need a new acronym for tech,” the “Mad Money” host said Monday. “FANG’s just not cutting it anymore because the gains are no longer limited to [that cohort].”

Former Nasdaq boss Robert Greifeld says we’ll remember WeWork as when the ‘unicorn’ bubble burst,EDT-201910:11-AM,"Perhaps the biggest parallel to the Internet bubble is a lack of business model that makes sense. WeWork essentially signs long-term leases, then sublets space for shorter periods at higher price. If commercial real estate values drop or the anticipated recession finally hits, this model may collapse. As billionaire real estate investor Sam Zell told CNBC recently, “They should have just changed the name of the company to ‘saving and loan.’ That’s really what you’re talking about, creating long-term liabilities and short-term assets. Every other time in history when they create that, results are predictable. Why is this any different?”
I hope the market’s decisive rejection of the WeWork story marks new skepticism about modern-day unicorns. If you are profitable and growing, WeWork’s fate won’t affect your value. If you have a clear path to profitability, this will be a blip. But if you’re losing billions with no end in site, the window of opportunity has shut. So try to score an invite to WeWork’s bash opening its European headquarters — and party like it’s 1999.

WeWork likewise hasn’t invented anything. It’s not even the first: Belgium’s IWG (formerly Regus) has been in the same business for decades. Unlike Airbnb or Uber
, which introduced genuinely innovative businesses, WeWork became a unicorn by packaging a commonplace offering in fancy décor and language. Its trademarked Physical Social Network is known to the rest of us as… a workplace. Even its office accouterments hark back to the ’90s startup culture, with arcade games, skating ramps and napping couches.As ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investing gains prominence, the focus tends to fall on sustainable practices on the “E” and “S” fronts. WeWork shows why “G” is the most important element of that formula: good governance may not assure a superior return but bad governance pretty much assures disaster. A litany of governance no-nos have come to light in recent months, from the CEO acting as his company’s landlord by leasing it real estate he owns to putting friends and family in executive positions. But none rankles more than the board agreeing to pay Neumann’s personal company almost $6 million for the “We” trademark — hardly a novel term.“We want to change the consciousness of the world,” Neumann proclaimed in WeWork’s IPO filing. That objective would seem a stretch for a company peddling shared workspaces, but Neumann seems blind to the hubris. WeWork has ventured to transform everything from education (with a start-up aiming to unleash kids’ “superpowers” by teaching them entrepreneurship and farming) to homes (through co-living apartments) to diet (the company banned meat from its office menus) to, perhaps more modestly, surfing (investing in artificial wave company Wavegarden).In the late 1990s, venture capital firms competed to shower dotcoms with millions based on little more than three-page business outlines. The resulting valuations had little connection with realistic expectations of returns. Today, huge private equity and venture funds are similarly chasing a limited pool of investment opportunities, but their bets have ballooned to billions. SoftBank, WeWork’s top investor, has plowed more than $10 billion into the company, which fits snugly into its model of putting rapid scale above profit. WeWork, which lost $4.2 billion since 2016 but boasts of 200%-plus “member” growth in that time, could be a posterchild for SoftBank’s philosophy. As now-deposed WeWork CEO Adam Neumann told Forbes in a 2017 profile, “Our valuation and size today are much more based on our energy and spirituality than it is on a multiple of revenue.”WeWork’s aborted IPO may come to mark the end of the current “unicorn” bubble the way the scuttled merger between Yahoo and eBay signaled the start of the dotcom crash in 2000. Having become CEO of Nasdaq in 2003, I saw up close the damage caused by the growth-over-profits philosophy in that earlier era, and WeWork’s spectacular fall — from the year’s most anticipated IPO to a company with a speculative-level credit rating that may run out of funds within a year —rings many bells.
Back in the late 1990s, tech CEOs bragged about innovative user interfaces, millions of eyeballs and empowered cultures; what they lacked were business models that could deliver returns for shareholders. WeWork has similarly put a flashy “user interface” on a mundane activity — sub-leasing office space — and wrapped itself in the jargon of world betterment and community to cover a corporate vision that lacks fundamental credibility.
Need more parallels? Consider:The growth-over-profits philosophy caused a lot of damage in the dotcom crash.
Like the 1990s, WeWork has similarly put a flashy “user interface” on a mundane activity and wrapped itself in the jargon of world betterment and community to cover a corporate vision that lacks fundamental credibility.
The funding feeding frenzy, messianic founders, lack of governance and unsustainable business model are among the similarities to the last big tech bubble.

China publishes final rules for new Nasdaq-style tech board,EST-201912:37-AM,"China has finalized regulations for a Nasdaq-style innovation board that promises to smooth the way for Chinese technology IPOs and, if successful, could raise Shanghai’s profile as a capital-raising competitor to Hong Kong and New York.
The stock market regulator late on Friday published the rules for the tech board after considering opinions from the public on draft regulations that were introduced on Jan. 30.
They took effect immediately. 
Listings on the new board will be done according to a registration system that limits official powers to control the timing of IPOs. In addition, some companies that are not yet profitable will be allowed to go public.
Those provisions alleviate two major impediments to companies seeking to tap existing equity capital markets in China.
China has long wanted its tech champions to list closer to home, but many of the best-known Chinese technology firms, including Alibaba Group
and Tencent Holdings
, chose to raise funds in international markets.
New York and Hong Kong accounted for nearly 70 percent of the money raised through Chinese IPOs last year.
In another sign plans for the new board are progressing, the financial news website Caixin reported that the Shanghai Stock Exchange had completed recruiting employees for the board and they were slated to start work in mid-March.If successful, it could raise Shanghai’s profile as a capital-raising competitor to Hong Kong and New York.

What the 9-week win streak could mean for Nasdaq stocks this month,EST-20193:49-PM,"The NASDAQ Composite ended last week in the green.
That makes it nine straight weeks that the index has been up.
Since 1980, there have been nine other 9-week winning streaks, according to a CNBC analysis using Kensho.
Historically, the index is mixed in the next week following these streaks.
But it’s up strongly again one full month later.
By then, it has gained an average of an additional 3.5%, trading higher nearly 80% of the time."
"Dow falls more than 300 points as Walgreens slides, but tech leads Nasdaq to record high",EDT-20204:17-PM,"Adding to the bearish sentiment Thursday was a Supreme Court ruling saying the Manhattan district attorney can look at President Donald Trump’s tax records as part of an investigation. 
“The Supreme Court ruling jolted the markets as it might deal a blow to Trump’s chance for re-election,” said Art Cashin, director of NYSE floor operations at UBS. “It did not bring in as much selling as it did spook the bulls so the market drifted down in a relative vacuum.”
But gains in some of the biggest tech-related names capped the losses Thursday. Amazon rose 3.3% to an all-time high. Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple were up at least 0.4% each. 
These stocks have outperformed this week as investors grow concerned the recent global coronavirus spikes could prolong the current economic downturn and force people to stay home for longer.
“A lot of these names are benefiting from the at-home play,” said Douglas Busch, founder of ChartSmarter. Busch noted that, from a technical perspective, he’d like to see consolidation in some of the major tech stocks but thinks they have further upside moving forward.
More than 3 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the U.S. alone, according to Johns Hopkins University. Globally, over 12 million cases have been confirmed.

—CNBC’s Michael Bloom and Patti Domm contributed to this report.The Dow Jones Industrial Average
fell sharply on Thursday, erasing its gains for the week, amid renewed concerns over the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. 
The 30-stock average dropped 361.19 points, or 1.4%, to 25,706.09. Thursday’s decline put the Dow 0.5% lower week to date. The S&P 500
slid 0.6% to 3,152.05. The Nasdaq Composite
 posted a record, rising 0.5% to 10,547.75.
Walgreens was the biggest laggard in the Dow, dropping 7.7% on weaker-than-expected earnings for the previous quarter. Walgreens also suspended a share repurchase program. Boeing fell more than 3%. 
Shares of companies that would benefit from the economy reopening struggled. United Airlines, Delta and American all fell more than 5%. Carnival Corp dropped 4.8% and Royal Caribbean slid 5.9%. Kohl’s declined by 7.3%.
Stocks hit their lows of the day after Florida reported a record in coronavirus-related hospitalizations. The state also reported a record spike in Covid deaths. California’s average daily case increase hit an all-time high as well. Equities recovered slightly, however, after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine candidate will likely enter phase 3 trials by the end of July.
“There’s less reason for optimism now than there was in April,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. “In April, we had a view on how long it would take to get a vaccine, and there was the possibility that we could open the country in stages and see a sustainable recovery.”
“We’re still looking at a vaccine sometime early next year, but it’s become clear that it’ll be very difficult to open without causing a renewed surge” in coronavirus cases, Thomas added."
Abrupt reversal in Nasdaq raises concern market may have seen summer high,EDT-20177:04-PM,"Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke, had a more positive view. “It’s hard to say just one day. I wouldn’t necessarily say just today means we’re going to go into a correction for the summer,” he said. “I think it’s more in the realm of profit-taking. On June 9, people said the same thing, and we came roaring back from that.”
Nasdaq favorites — the FANG stocks: Facebook,
Amazon,
Netflix
and Google parent, Alphabet
—were mixed in the sell-off, with Facebook higher after its earnings. Amazon closed 0.6 percent lower at 1,046, after reaching an all-time high of 1083.31 Thursday morning. It fell even more in after hours trading after its earnings missed expectations. .
Besides tech, biotech also joined in the sell-off. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology
IBB ETF fell 2.3 percent in afternoon trading.
Transports were also crushed in the sell-off. The Dow Jones Transports
were down 3.2 percent. The VIX,
a measure of market volatility, jumped 7 percent to 10.30 after trading at an all-time low this week.
The sell-off comes amid warnings from some strategists that the market could see a shallow pullback after going for so long without a correction. The market’s last significant pullback was the 11 percent decline in the S&P 500 that ended in February 2016.
The S&P 500 fell about a half percent in afternoon trading, to 2,465. The Dow held some gains, up 6 points, at 21,717.Nasdaq Thursday closed down 40 points at 6,382, significant to technicians because it fell below Wednesday’s low of 6,416, after shooting into record territory on the open. Nasdaq Wednesday had set a third record close in a row. For the month to date, it was still up just about 4 percent.
Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said the reversal was evident in the QQQs, or the PowerShares QQQ Trust
ETF, which represents the Nasdaq 100. The ETF opened at an all-time high Thursday but then fell below Wednesday’s low of 144.53, a classic outside reversal. It ended the day down 0.6 percent at 143.96.

“On Facebook’s earnings, it gapped everything up, and basically they sold the news, causing a big outside bearish reversal in tech. That was a little bit of a red flag. The QQQs were at an all-time high,” Redler said. “It’s pure technicals. You open up above a momentum level, go through it, and people start to sell. Technology opened up strong and basically reversed.”
The QQQs traded over 77.2 million shares as of the close, almost double its 30-day average of 39.8 million shares.
The Dow
and S&P 500 did not see the same type of “outside” move, and the Dow in fact closed at a record 21,796, up 85 points. The down 2 at 2475.
“The fact you made a new high in the Dow and didn’t reverse, the old guard would call that a day when the tape was being painted,” said Gartman. “If they had all reversed to the downside, it would have been much more impressive.” But he said the fact that tech has been leading the market’s gains makes the reversals in the QQQs and Nasdaq significant.The abrupt reversal in Nasdaq stocks raises a red flag for technicians and signals a possible summer top for the market.
Nasdaq, home to many big techs and biotechs, dropped like a rock in early afternoon trading, in a move that traders said did not appear to have a catalyst other than a rash of selling just before 1:30 p.m. ET in an overbought sector.

Nasdaq ekes out 8-day winning streak after Fed releases minutes,EST-20194:11-PM,"The U.S. dollar hit its session low after the minutes were released, but later recovered to trade around breakeven. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), considered the best gauge of fear in the market, was down 5.7 percent around 14.
On Jan. 30, the Fed it will be “patient” in tightening monetary policy moving forward and kept interest rates unchanged.
Stocks have been on a tear lately in part because of the Fed’s perceived pause on rate hikes. The Dow and Nasdaq are riding an eight-week winning streak, while the S&P 500 is up seven of the past eight weeks. Since the Fed’s meeting in January, the major indexes are all up more than 4 percent.
Investors are also watching out for developments on U.S.-China trade talks as officials launched a new round of negotiations on Tuesday. A follow-up session of higher-level talks is expected later in the week, as both sides look to resolve the long-running trade war before an early March deadline.
“We think part of the recovery in share prices is with the suggestion that we’ve seen progress in [trade] talks,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “To sustain this, we need to actually see policy and not just progress.”
President Donald Trump has suggested he might extend the deadline for a deal, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday that March 1 was not a “magical date.” An extension to the current deadline would prevent an immediate increase in tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent.
But while stocks are up sharply, Treasury yields have also fallen sharply. The benchmark 10-year note yield traded around 2.78 percent on Jan 18. On Wednesday, it hovered around 2.65 percent.
“The stock market reads that the Fed is going to ease off on where they thought they were going with interest rates and perhaps holding on to more of their balance sheet, all of which was interpreted as good news,” said Dave Campbell, principal at BOS. “Bond investors are looking at the exact same data and say the Fed is acknowledging the risks out there by slowing down.”
CVS Health shares fell more than 8 percent after issuing a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for 2019. The company’s guidance comes after closing a $70 billion deal to acquire health insurer Aetna in November.
Southwest airlines fell 5.65 percent after slashing its revenue guidance. The company said the recent U.S. government shutdown cost it $60 million in sales.

The Fed meeting minutes highlighted downside risks to the economy from its January meeting, including “the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stimulus, or a further tightening of financial market conditions.”
“Slowing growth has been a low humming chorus in the market for a while now and today we’re hearing the Fed join in, which is a significant departure from the goldilocks rhetoric we’ve heard from them in the past,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade. “That said, slow growth does not mean recession.”
However, some equity investors may be encouraged by language in the minutes regarding its hotly debated balance sheet normalization. Bulls want the Fed to stop reducing its balance sheet, arguing that practice is a de facto tightening of monetary conditions. The central bank did hint in the minutes that it may end its balance-sheet normalization this year.
“Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings later this year,” the minutes stated. ’Such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.”"

Datadog pops 39% in Nasdaq debut as cloud software IPOs stay hot,EDT-20194:21-PM,"Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.Datadog
, a cloud software company that sells analytics and monitoring tools, surged 39% in its stock market debut on Thursday, becoming the latest subscription software company to be met with enthusiasm by public market investors.
Trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DDOG,” the stock climbed to $40.50 out of the gate, up from the $27 IPO price, valuing the company at $10.9 billion. It closed the trading day at $37.55.
Datadog, which competes with cloud providers Amazon
and Microsoft
, as well as Cisco
, Elastic
and Splunk
, follows Crowdstrike
, Zoom
and other fast-growing software companies onto the public markets, where investors are showing a preference for the more predictable metrics than they get from cash-burning consumer companies like Uber
and Lyft
.
Datadog’s subscription-based offering helps developers and administrators make sure their applications and underlying infrastructure are working properly. The software can track performance for systems running in public clouds, or in corporate data centers.
At its current market cap, Datadog is being valued at about 41 times trailing 12-month revenue, which makes it among the priciest cloud software stocks on the market. Zoom is the only company with a higher price-to-sales ratio at about 50, according to FactSet, and Crowdstrike is next at 44.
In the first six months of 2019, Datadog’s revenue jumped 79% to $153.4 million. The company recorded a net loss of $13.4 million in the first half of the year as research and development costs doubled and sales and marketing costs increased almost as much.
Datadog first filed to go public on Aug. 23. It later provided a price range of $19 to $22, before raising the range this week to $24 to $26. It ultimately priced $1 above that range, selling 24 million shares and raising $648 million. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Cisco offered to buy Datadog for more than $7 billion in recent weeks, citing people familiar with the matter. The company wasn’t interested, according to the report, and Datadog CEO Olivier Pomel declined to comment to CNBC on Thursday.
Underwriters will have the option to buy an additional 3.6 million shares. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan chase and Credit Suisse led the IPO.
Datadog was founded in 2010 and is based in New York. Earlier investors include Index Ventures, OpenView Venture Partners, ICONIQ Strategic Partners and RTP Ventures.

"Nasdaq and S&P 500 reach all-time highs as Amazon, Alphabet and Apple rally",EDT-20187:16-PM,"“This is actually not a surprise for us,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management. “We knew Mexico was going to make a deal, but there was going to be some pushback. ... With Canada, we think there’s going to be a bit less pushback.”
As trade tensions ease, Lloyd said he likes U.S. equities, “preferably large-cap” stocks. “The dollar rally will likely start to curb,” thus boosting shares of large multinational companies.
The U.S. economy grew at a stronger pace in the second quarter than previously thought. The Commerce Department raised its second-quarter economy growth estimate to 4.2 percent from an initial forecast of 4.1 percent.
“Today’s estimate should also serve as another lesson to shelf geopolitical noise and focus on the fundamentals, which are nothing if not strong,” said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E-Trade. “Jobs numbers are robust, and this number comes in after earnings season, which reflects broad corporate growth, particularly in retail, which bodes well for our economy. Some say we’re late in the business cycle, but clearly there’s more gas in the tank at least for now.”“It’s always positive for the market when there are negotiations,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The advantage Mexico had was that they have a new leader coming in, even though the outgoing president was also involved. With Canada, you have the same cast of negotiators” from when talks broke down.
The Canadian dollar rose marginally against its U.S. counterpart, erasing earlier losses. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there is a possibility a trade deal that includes Canada could be reached by Friday. He noted, however, that any NAFTA deal must be “the right deal for Canada.”
President Donald Trump said later on Wednesday he was optimistic that Canada will join the U.S.-Mexico trade deal.

Analyst Brian Nowak said Amazon’s advertising, subscription and cloud businesses “will drive higher profitability and continued upward estimate revisions.” Amazon’s stock closed at $1,998.10.
Shares of Google-parent Alphabet gained 1.5 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock, making it the highest on Wall Street. The analysts cited Waymo, the company’s self-driving auto unit, as the big upside catalyst for the stock. Alphabet shares closed at $1,264.65.

"Tech stocks have moved from ‘un-investable’ to good bets, and that could send the Nasdaq up 10 percent this year: Investor Paul Meeks",EST-201912:10-AM,"Technology investor Paul Meeks is no longer avoiding the group that made him famous on Wall Street.
Meeks, who ran the world’s biggest tech fund for Merrill Lynch in the late 1990s and early 2000s, expects the tech-heavy Nasdaq
to end the year at least 10 percent higher.
“I’m starting to creep out of the bunker,” he said Friday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “I would say that when you get to December 31 of this year, the Nasdaq will be up double digit in calendar 2019. And, it will outperform both the Dow
and the [500 Index].”
It’s a material shift for Meeks. Late last year, he was telling investors that most tech names were “uninvestable.” Now, he believes tech valuations have come down enough to start putting money to work again — as long as it’s done with vigilance.
“Some companies are doing quite well, and some are giving very mixed even bearish guidance. So you have to be super careful,” he said.
For example, when it comes to FANG names Facebook
, Amazon
, Netflix
and Alphabet
, Meeks owns them all. However, he wouldn’t add positions to all of them right now.
“The only one I think I would buy here because I think it is the best among the group combination of valuation support and upside potential is Alphabet,” he said.
According to Meeks, tech stocks could still see some near-term turbulence especially around the U.S.-China trade war deadline on March 1. However, the investment picture should begin to improve after that.
“A lot of the gains are going to come between the summer and the end of the year — a second half phenomenon,” Meeks said.
For the week ending Friday, the Nasdaq is up a half percent, and it remains in correction territory."
S&P 500 and Nasdaq close at record highs as Netflix jumps,EDT-20184:19-PM,"The dollar fell to trade 0.6 percent lower against a basket of currencies following Powell’s speech. The greenback’s fall helped boost gold and oil prices, which are both traded in dollars.
“The dollar has gone up a bit recently; it’s been a pretty crowded trade,” said Aaron Hurd, senior portfolio manager of currency at State Street Global Advisors. “I think people have been looking for any reason to sell the dollar.”
Sentiment was also boosted by strong earnings and solid economic data being reported earlier this week.
Retailers Lowe’s and Target reported better-than-expected earnings this week, sending their shares up 9 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.
Target CEO Brian Cornell raved about the state of the economy after the company’s results were released, noting: “There’s no doubt that, like others, we’re currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment — perhaps the strongest I’ve seen in my career.”
President Donald Trump included Cornell’s comments in a tweet, calling it “a big statement from a top executive.”

Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims fell to 210,000, near levels not seen since 1969. Core durable goods orders rose 1.4 percent in July, more than the expected 0.4 percent increase.
“The numbers show the economy is strong and the consumer keeps spending,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. But investors are not pricing “stories that could add risk to the market.”
The strong results from retailers led the major indexes to slight weekly gains as investors also shook off renewed legal worries surrounding Trump. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.9 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. The Dow rose half a percent this week.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal lawyer, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to eight counts related to tax fraud, campaign contributions, making false statements to a financial institution and unlawful corporate contributions. Cohen also admitted to making payments to two women at the direction of Trump. Meanwhile, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was found guilty on eight counts in a separate case.

Earlier this week, tariffs against U.S. and Chinese goods came into effect.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached all-time highs on Friday as Netflix shares rose.

Netflix rose 5.8 percent on Friday after analysts at SunTrust upgraded the stock, noting it will keep going higher because of its success overseas. The stock has had a strong week, gaining more than 10 percent this week.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered a speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming, where leading central bankers met to discuss the future of monetary policy.
Powell said he sees “further, gradual” rate hikes moving forward, noting the economy is “strong” and can handle tighter monetary policy.
“The market wasn’t sure how hawkish he was going to be,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade. “I think the biggest takeaway from the speech is he doesn’t see inflation rising meaningfully above 2 percent, ... so a gradual pace of rate hikes is still appropriate.”"

Of those companies, 76 percent have reported better-than-expected earnings. Overall, S&P 500 earnings for the second quarter are up more than 24 percent versus the year-earlier period.
Booking Holdings and Norwegian Cruise Line both reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line rose more than 4 percent, but Booking Holdings fell after issuing a weak third-quarter profit forecast.
“Earnings drive markets and earnings have been fantastic,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “As much as people want to talk about fear, the Vix, gold and a lot of other things are telling you that maybe you should not be so fearful.”
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered to be the best fear gauge in the market traded at 11.2 after hitting its lowest level since mid-January. Meanwhile, gold futures are trading near their lowest levels in over a year.
Trade tensions have simmered throughout the strong earnings season, however. Beijing announced Wednesday it would counter the most recent round of U.S. tariffs with its own. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced a 25 percent charge on $16 billion worth of U.S. goods.

The CBOE and the CME have also announced plans to launch futures tied to the cryptocurrency shortly. A Nasdaq
spokesperson said that the exchange’s futures would differentiate from CBOE and CME because Nasdaq would base its price off of 50 bitcoin sources from around the world, while CBOE is currently using one and the CME is using four.

One issue facing bitcoin products is the issue of what happens if there is a “hard fork,” i.e. what happens if bitcoin splits into competing products. Nasdaq said that both sides of the fork would go in the index for one day, and after that the value of the other fork would be reinvested in bitcoin and the value of the index would be adjusted.
So, for example, if bitcoin at $11,000 split into two forks of $9,000 and $2.000, both would remain in the index for a day, and then the $2,000 fork would be reinvested in the $9,000 bitcoin and the index would be adjusted.
Bitcoin broke above $11,000 for the first time Wednesday and is up more than 1,000 percent in 2017.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the Nasdaq futures launch. The Journal also reported that Cantor Fitzgerald is working to launch a bitcoin derivative next year.

"Canadian marijuana company’s Nasdaq listing bodes well for the industry, but US companies still face barriers",EST-20184:06-PM,"Cronos Group CEO Michael Gorenstein, who grew up in Ohio, left a prestigious career working in corporate law in New York City three years ago to take a risk on the cannabis industry. But his years of experience in law told him starting a marijuana business in the U.S. would be no easy feat.
“I started thinking it was going to be very, very difficult in this federally illegal environment to actually build a global business — which is very rare because when it comes to starting a business, there is usually no better place than the U.S.,” Gorenstein said.
So he turned to Canada, where he co-founded Cronos Group, to avoid regulatory snags until things changed in the Lower 48.
“If it’s fully legalized tomorrow, we’d enter by 12:01 a.m.,” Gorenstein joked.
Stock exchanges have very stringent requirements for companies looking to list, including restrictions on those that have broken federal law, according to Beacon Securities analyst Vahan Ajamian. That means companies based in countries where marijuana is federally legal, i.e. Canada, may meet listing requirements in the U.S., while U.S.-based companies cannot.
U.S. marijuana companies are allowed to list on Canadian exchanges, so long as they fully disclose all risks to investors, but the Toronto Stock Exchange has forbidden it. The world’s ninth largest exchange announced in October that U.S. cannabis companies can not meet listing requirements because they violate federal law in their home countries.
There are some options for U.S. companies looking to go public. Eligible companies can list on alternative exchanges, like U.S. over-the-counter exchanges and the Canadian Securities Exchange, but these types of exchanges typically result in less access to major institutional investors. Even if a U.S. marijuana company lists in Canada, Ajamaian said it will likely trade at a discount to Canadian companies, especially after retail marijuana goes legal.
The irony is not lost on California-based cannabis company MedMen, which announced its intention to go public on the CSE in April.
“That’s the irony here. You have a Canadian company doing much the same as MedMen does, but they can list on the Nasdaq and MedMen cannot, because of the laws in this country,” said Daniel Yi, spokesperson for MedMen.
Listing early on an exchange like Nasdaq can present some major advantages to companies, including giving them global reach and access to professional investors. And most anticipate Cronos Group’s move will encourage other Canadian cannabis companies to follow suit. In fact, Canada’s largest marijuana company has already expressed its intention to do just that.
Ajamian confirmed that Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy Growth, announced during a private lunch on Thursday his intention to list the company on the Nasdaq. Ajamian anticipates that could happen in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.
The Canadian market may be getting a leg up over the U.S., but most aren’t overly concerned that the Canada will leave its southern neighbor in the dust.
“Canada and other countries have benefited from learning from what has happened in the U.S. [marijuana industry]. The U.S. can now learn lessons from Canada going legal,” CanopyBoulder’s Rea said.When a Canadian marijuana company listed on the Nasdaq last week, most in the cannabis industry said it was an important milestone in the fight toward legitimization.
“Every success means future success for the industry. Every successful investment, every successful individual and every successful company brings us closer to legalization,” said Patrick Rea, the co-founder of CanopyBoulder, a firm that gives financial backing and advice to startups in the industry.
It is a sign of change even though U.S. cannabis companies remain relegated to alternative exchanges. In the U.S. marijuana is prohibited under federal law, despite being legalized in several states.
Toronto-based Cronos Group
owns medical marijuana growing and distribution operations in Australia, Canada, Germany and Israel — all countries where medical marijuana is legal. The company made history last Tuesday by becoming the first “plant-touching” cannabis company, or company that deals directly with the cannabis plant, to list on a major U.S. exchange.
It is also listed to trade in Canada and Germany.
“It is a significant signal that a major U.S. exchange does not have an issue with cannabis, but rather the U.S. federal status,” wrote Hadley Ford, CEO of iAnthus Capital, a U.S. cannabis company listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange.
Cronos Group stock isn’t the first marijuana-related asset to make it to a major U.S. exchange.
In December, Alternative Harvest ETF
, a fund that trades on the NYSE Arca, started investing in marijuana companies — Cronos Group, included. By March, it had increased its assets under management to more than $400 million and given investors access to a basket of marijuana stocks.
But Cronos Group’s listing on the Nasdaq represents the first time investors can get behind a specific cannabis stock.Cronos Group made history by becoming the first “plant-touching” cannabis company, or company that deals directly with the cannabis plant, to list on a major U.S. exchange.
Many in the industry consider the listing a major win, but U.S. companies still cannot enjoy similar privileges.
Some anticipate Cronos Group’s move could open the floodgates to more Canadian cannabis companies listing in the U.S."

Nasdaq accuses IEX of copying expensive trading technology,EST-20188:09-AM,"Nasdaq
is suing its relatively new exchange rival IEX Group, claiming it infringed on several patents for electronic trading technology that took millions of dollars to develop.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday in New Jersey federal court, Nasdaq says IEX, also known as the Investors Exchange, employs several former Nasdaq workers who were familiar with the technology there and who have been involved in developing IEX’s trading operation.
IEX has said it designed some of its technology based on extensive review of Nasdaq’s processes, the lawsuit claims. The tech-stock-heavy Nasdaq said a key feature of its technology that is protected by patents is substantially similar to how IEX works.
The exchange world has been in an upheaval over the last decade as electronic trading took over. IEX emerged as a new exchange in 2016 with a system that slowed down trading in an effort to neutralize the effect of high-frequency trading.
Nasdaq said in a statement, “These seven patents cover important innovations that we, and our customers, rely on for reliability, scalability, and transparency.”
In its own statement, IEX said, “Similar to our exchange application process, this is yet another attempt by Nasdaq to obstruct an innovative new competitor.”IEX, also known as the Investors Exchange, emerged as a new exchange in 2016.

"Nasdaq acquires Sybenetix, a software firm that uses A.I. to sniff out rogue traders",EDT-20174:20-AM,"Nasdaq
acquired a London-based regulatory technology firm Sybenetix which uses algorithms to catch rogue traders, the company said on Tuesday.
The stock exchange said it is paying an undisclosed amount and intends to fund the purchase with cash.
“Nasdaq is investing in the technologies, talent and capabilities that solve the complex challenges our clients face,” Adena Friedman, president and CEO of Nasdaq, said in a press release on Tuesday.
“We believe behavioral science, cognitive computing and machine intelligence are essential to a successful, holistic surveillance offering and critical to efficient and effective organizational compliance with an increasingly intricate global regulatory environment.”
Sybenetix uses algorithms to learn individual or group behavior at an organization. The software can then detect any unusual trading behavior and report that to the compliance team. Nasdaq already has some of its own risk and surveillance solutions, and the latest acquisition will add to its offerings.
There’s a rising interest in regulatory technology companies amid increasingly complex regulations being put on financial institutions. Last year, regulatory technology companies raised $732 million globally with 102 companies getting funding, marking the highest number of deals, according to CB Insights.
Sybenetix will sit within the market technology business of Nasdaq which accounted for 12 percent of total net revenues in the first quarter.
“Being part of Nasdaq will provide enormous growth opportunities for Sybenetix’s surveillance technologies and will also accelerate new product development for the buy-side industry,” Taras Chaban, CEO and Wendy Jephson, chief behavioral scientist, said in a joint statement.
“Our clients will benefit from the added confidence of working with a world-leading company that understands the business and requirements of Sybenetix’s buy-side customers.”Nasdaq acquired regulatory technology firm Sybenetix for an undisclosed sum.

Bitcoin had a huge rally in 2017 but has so far got off to a tepid start this year. Cryptocurrencies across the board recently suffered a huge sell-off.
Many have also poured cold water over cryptocurrencies in the past year. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a “fraud” while legendary investor Warren Buffett told CNBC that digital currencies will come to a “bad ending.”
Still, many have also talked up the potential of cryptocurrencies in 2018. Julian Hosp, co-founder of TenX, a firm that wants to make it easier for people to spend virtual currencies, told CNBC in December that bitcoin could hit $60,000 in 2018, but could crash first. And Dave Chapman, managing director of cryptocurrency trading firm Octagon Strategy, said that bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018.Rivals the Cboe and CME Group have both launched bitcoin futures contracts in the past few months. But speaking during an interview at The Sanctuary in Davos, Switzerland, Friedman said that the Nasdaq will offer a different type of contract.
The Nasdaq CEO explained the Cboe and CME offerings operate by tracking the price of bitcoin
and operate in reference to its future price. But, the Nasdaq wants to offer a contract different from what Cboe and CME Group have.
“What we might look at is more of a total return futures, so it’s a little bit of a different construct,” she said, adding that it meant it was “more of an investment than a tracking stock.” This suggests the product might track a spot rate rather than any future price.The Nasdaq
is assessing how to offer cryptocurrency futures in a way that none of its competitors have so far managed, the CEO of the stock exchange told CNBC Tuesday.
Adena Friedman confirmed earlier reports that the Nasdaq is looking into bitcoin futures, but did not give a timeline for a launch or if it will definitely happen. Though her comments suggest that the development of a product is indeed happening.
“We are continuing to investigate the idea of a cryptocurrency futures (contract) with a partner and we continue to look at the risk management around that, making sure we are putting the right protocols in place, making sure there’s proper demand, and that the contract is different from what’s already out there,” Friedman told CNBC.Adena Friedman confirmed earlier reports that the Nasdaq is looking into bitcoin futures, but did not give a timeline for a launch or if it will definitely happen

“The consumer and government spending drove all of the gain in GDP as trade, inventories and investment reversed the Q1 gains,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in a note. “On the question that everyone tries to answer in light of the longest economic expansion on record, when will we see the next recession, I again believe it will be determined by the direction of the stock market.”
The data release comes as investors await a potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week. Market expectations for a 25 basis-point rate cut were at 78.6% on Friday morning, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
The Fed is scheduled to start its two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. An announcement on rates is set for Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.
“The market owes its strength in large part to the Fed eases priced in. And the Fed has noted the slowdown in business resulting from the generally slower global economy,” said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard. “The net of this is ... the Fed has no option other than to cut 25 on Wednesday and see whether the data unfold to create the need for a further cut in September.

Leaders from seven of the largest economies in the world are set to meet in Canada this week at a time when trade tensions between the U.S. and key trade partners have increased.

The increased prices will either be passed onto consumers, or will impact margins.”
“From an indirect perspective, the process around trade negotiations has been fraught with stutter steps and reversals, and has contributed to a general sense of uncertainty over the direction of the global economy,” said Nixon. “It is unequivocal that broad based tariffs or a trade war will put a constraint on global growth while lifting the structural governor on inflation.”

More than 15% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings thus far. Of those companies, 79% have posted a better-than-expected profit, according to FactSet data. 
“So far, there have been no surprises,” said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. “Most of the times when the bar is set so low, the results are likely to be in line or slightly better.”
Entering the earnings season, analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to have fallen by around 3%, according to FactSet data. Next week will be busy for investors as about 25% of the S&P 500 is slated to report quarterly results.
“Little is expected from the current earnings season,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group, in a note. However, there are “two favorable aspects impacting corporate profitability which may be underappreciated.”
“Many believe CEO outlooks have been severely shaken by ongoing uncertainties, but ‘behavioral indicators’ suggest CEOs remain more confident than perceived,” he said. “Second, the economic slowdown this year has produced an overlooked silver lining for earnings—it has enhanced the potential for renewed profit margin expansion as costs across the spectrum (labor, capital and materials cost) have declined.”
Stocks eked out small gains in the previous session after New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the central bank needed to “act quickly” when the economy was slowing and rates were low, adding in a speech that it is “better to take preventative measures than wait for disaster to unfold.”
Those comments led traders to price in a greater possibility that the Fed would cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the end of the month.
However, a spokesperson for the New York Fed moved to cool the speculation arising from Williams’ comments, telling CNBC that he was drawing from academic research, not hinting at potential policy actions at the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.
“Maybe the New York Fed is walking it back a bit because they don’t want to prejudge what will happen at the [July] meeting,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. “But I believe that if they’re going to do it,” the Fed should be cutting rates by 50 basis points.
“They really need to convince guys like me and the people that control a lot of the money on Wall Street that they are truly serious about reinflating the economy,” he said.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq close at record highs as optimism on US economy remains,EST-20184:16-PM,"B. Riley’s Hogan said this earnings season will be “complicated” as investors search for clues about how the changes to the U.S. tax code will impact each company.
President Donald Trump signed a bill last month that slashed the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Stocks pushed higher throughout 2017 as investors bet on a lower tax rate for companies.
“Analysts have begun to lift earnings estimates aggressively as a consequence of the rewriting of the tax code,” said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. “Expected profits for the S&P 500 for 2018 have grown by nearly 3% since early October with half of these gains coming in the past week.”
“To be sure, stocks are expensive. Nevertheless, those bullish have surmised that shares will get more attractive as bottom line forecasts continue to rise out of deference to the fiscal stimulus,” Klein said.

The Nasdaq 100 is on pace to do something it hasn’t since the tech bubble,EDT-20172:01-PM,"It’s been a great year for big tech stocks, and a pretty meager one for the small caps; the Nasdaq 100
index is up 20 percent this year, while the Russell 2000
has risen by less than 3 percent, through Thursday’s close. If that pace continues, 2017 will witness the greatest outperformance for the Nasdaq 100 as compared to the Russell 2000 since 1999.
To be sure, even if the Nasdaq 100 does beat the Russell 2000 by 40 percent this year, that will still only represent half of the staggering, 82 percent outperformance seen in 1999, when the Nasdaq 100 more than doubled in value. That came on the back of an 85 percent rise for the Nasdaq in 1998, a year in which the Russell actually dropped.
This year, the disparate performances for the two indices can be pegged largely on the huge surge seen in a few big tech stocks, as well as the more general matter of sector mix.
Just five companies now make up more than 40 percent of the Nasdaq 100: Apple
, Microsoft
, Amazon
, Facebook
, and Alphabet
. All have performed exceptionally this year. In fact, Piper Jaffray technical analyst Craig Johnson found that without the so-called “FANG” stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix
and Google parent Alphabet) the Nasdaq would have advanced just 13 percent this year. And this 13 percent figure includes the large contribution of Apple, which is the largest component and has gained about 33 percent this year.
The outperformance of the big-tech-fueled Nasdaq 100 could speak to “this winner-take-all economy that we’re in, where a few large companies are getting a bigger and bigger share of the profit pie,” said Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management.
“This is actually not a good thing for the economy or for the society as a whole,” Schlossberg said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
At the same time, sector performance has been a large factor as well. The Nasdaq 100 is 58 percent information technology, 22 percent consumer discretionary, and 10 percent healthcare; of that consumer discretionary piece, nearly half is made up by Amazon, Priceline
, Netflix and Tesla
, which might be broadly characterized as tech stocks.
Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 is just 18 percent information technology. Financials are the heavyweight, with a 19 percent weighting, and industrials make up 14 percent of the index. So far this year, the information technology sector is the big market leader followed by consumer discretionary, and financials have lagged far behind.
For Schlossberg, there’s a political flavor to this sector story.
“The Russell [is showing] disappointment in the Trump trade, in the sense that a lot of people were waiting for a lot of things to help small businesses — tax policy, regulatory policy — and none of that has really come through,” the strategist said.
After all, the small-cap index surged following Donald Trump’s election. Financials and industrials were supposed to be serious beneficiaries of his regulation-slashing, infrastructure-building policies. And more generally, trade-protectionist policies were supposed to harm large multinational companies while perhaps helping small domestic ones.
With little having been done in Washington, that trade has dramatically turned around. Meanwhile, hopes for lower taxes on repatriated money is good for tech companies hoarding money overseas.
The fact that tech has led so dramatically, meanwhile, is not a good thing in Johnson’s book.
“As a technician, I want to see the rest of the market kick in before we can really make that big leg higher in the overall market,” Johnson said.
Despite this year’s trend, the Russell is enjoying a good start to Friday, following an impressive Thursday performance."
The Nasdaq is about to do something it hasn’t done in nearly four decades,EST-201712:38-PM,"DisclaimerIt’s no secret to market watchers that the Nasdaq has seen a monster year, up nearly 30 percent year to date and on pace for 14 months of nearly uninterrupted gains.
But there’s one more record to add to the books: the technology-heavy index is on pace for its sixth straight positive year, its longest annual string of gains since its six-year streak ended in 1980.
The Nasdaq
also has posted a record number of all-time high closes this year.
These highs come as many are concerned with some parallels being drawn between the index’s recent price action and that of the dot-com bubble era. Some see the rally petering out next year.
“It’s probably going to push a little bit higher into early 2018,” said Max Wolff, chief economist of The Phoenix Group, Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
“We would say that both tech and the rally overall is getting really long in the tooth, so somewhere toward the middle point of 2018 we think this is going to run out of steam. But we’re not quite there yet. Tech is expensive, but at least it’s growing, and there’s plenty else you could buy that’s expensive and not growing,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq and an index comprised of semiconductor stocks have diverged recently, a development that concerns Miller Tabak equity strategist Matt Maley. The Nasdaq and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index
have been generally correlated this year, but have deviated from one another in the last month.
“One of the things we have to look at is that as much as the ‘FANGs’ were certainly a key leadership area of the tech group, we also got a lot of leadership out of the semiconductor stocks,” he said, referring to the tech heavyweight quartet of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet.
“They’ve begun to diverge a little bit. They’re starting to sell off a little bit; you can see the semiconductor index has come down,” he said, calling the deviation “worrisome.”
This may pose a concern for the broader technology space, Maley suggested, if the divergence continues.

The major indexes posted slight weekly losses. The Dow and S&P 500 both fell 0.5 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq pulled back 0.7 percent. The move lower this week took place after the averages jumped more than 2 percent last week.
Helping push stocks lower this week were higher interest rates. The benchmark 10-year note yield broke above 3.1 percent for the first time since 2011 this week, while the two-year yield traded at its highest level in nearly 10 years. Fears of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy faster than expected have pushed investors to sell Treasurys recently.

On Thursday, the two largest economies in the world began the second round of trade talks. But President Donald Trump told reporters he doubted the negotiations would be successful.
Later, reports emerged saying China would offer the U.S. a $200 billion trade surplus cut. Those reports, however, were quickly denied by a Chinese ministry spokesman on Friday. “This rumor is not true.

But “in this recovery we have a very involved central bank, and really global central banks, applying quantitative easing.”
“There’s virtually 100% chance that the Fed will lower rates at the July meeting. I think the Fed will see the economic indicators in the United States are beginning to slow.”
A tweet from President Donald Trump calling for easier monetary policy added to expectations of easier Fed policy. Trump said the U.S. should “match” monetary policies from China and Europe, noting they are “playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA.”
Tweet
The U.S. dollar fell after Trump’s tweet, but remained little changed on the day. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level since 2016 on Wednesday, falling further below 2%.
Wall Street has been clamoring for lower rates after the Fed hiked four times in 2018. Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors, thinks investors should be careful with what they wish for.
“The market is a little bit optimistic, not only about a cut but what it represents,” Courtney said. “I don’t think the Fed wants to send a signal that things are weakening unless they really are.”
Wall Street got off to a strong start this week following a trade truce between the two world’s two largest economies. The S&P 500 is up more than 1% week to date and has posted back-to-back record closes.
The U.S. and China agreed to restart trade talks over the weekend, after President Donald Trump offered concessions — including no new charges and an easing of restrictions on tech company Huawei — to soothe tensions with Beijing.
However, the initial enthusiasm over the latest trade truce between Washington and Beijing has since been overtaken by intensifying concerns over the Trump administration’s threat of tariffs on additional European goods.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office released a list of products — including olives, Italian cheese, and Scotch whiskey — that could be hit with new levies in addition to those introduced in April. It comes after the U.S. government threatened to impose tariffs on $4 billion worth of EU goods on Monday, as part of a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies.

“The first time we get there you’ll probably see some profit-taking,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com. “If technology continues to be strong and the semiconductors get some kind of bounce, that could probably push the S&P 500 through it 3,000.

DraftKings CEO says there was record interest in NFL Draft as company debuts on Nasdaq,EDT-20202:23-PM,"DraftKings
CEO Jason Robins said the company saw record betting volume on the NFL Draft ahead of DraftKings’ debut Friday on the Nasdaq
. 
“It was a really big betting event relative to prior years,” Robins said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “It shows that there’s pent-up demand. People want football. People want traditional sports. I think when you do see a return to play, it’s going to be a really, really big deal for the country.”  
The lack of traditional sports due to the coronavirus “certainly” has impacted revenues for the daily fantasy sports company and bookmaker, Robins said. “But e-sports has been absolutely exploding.”
“We’ve also seen alternative sports like table tennis really start to pick up in popularity,” he added. 
DraftKings, which will trade under the ticker DKNG, became public through a three-way merger that involves a special purpose acquisition company, or blank-check company. It announced its plans to go public through the SPAC in December.
SBTech, a betting and gaming technology company, was the third party in the merger. The SPAC, launched by veteran Hollywood executives, went public in May. It had been called Diamond Eagle Acquisition. 
Shares of DraftKings were up more than 8% on Friday to around $19 per share. 
Robins said DraftKings, as it discussed last year plans about going public, recognized there could be volatility in the stock market — although they were not predicting a pandemic would be its cause. 
He said that is one reason why going public through SPAC worked well for the company. 
“From a mechanical standpoint, this was really more like closing an M&A transaction,” he said. “We had a very clear measuring stick. We knew where the stock was trading, so we felt good about closing the transaction right now.” 
Robins said it is difficult to forecast DraftKings’ revenues because the company cannot predict how long major U.S. sports leagues are out of action. 
“We do see that there are other things customers are engaging with,” he said, noting that it offered free-to-play pools for episodes of HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Survivor” on CBS
, for example.
He said it also saw strong participation in a trivia game for Netflix’
s “Tiger King.”  
“We’re finding ways to engage customers, and we all hope that traditional sports will return soon,” Robins said. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said the company saw record betting volume on the NFL Draft ahead of its debut Friday on the Nasdaq.

"Nasdaq 6,000 is in sight, thanks to tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft",EDT-20177:39-PM,"“I have been a little bit surprised at the sheer magnitude of the strength,” Joshua Spencer, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on Monday. “I think it reflects some of the fundamentals we see at these companies. If you look across the board, tech fundamentals have been very good in internet, software and semiconductors, so there’s been a good backdrop.”
While smaller companies exposed to President Donald Trump’s agenda — like defense or infrastructure firms — saw early gains after the election, markets have gradually been moving toward bigger names, said Scott Kessler, equity analyst at CFRA Research.
Kessler said the rally among the biggest tech names is likely a combination of the companies’ performance and a sense of overall enthusiasm in the stock market.
“Are they leading because they are big, or are they big because they are leading? I kind of think there’s a little of both,” Kessler said. He added: “Part of it is these companies executing well, people are excited about what’s to come. They allow investors to focus on the megatrends of what a lot of us are doing — virtual or augmented reality, self-driving cars — massive greenfields where companies are making tremendous investments.”
Kessler’s firm has a “strong buy” or “buy” rating on all of the “big five” except Microsoft, in part driven by the companies’ earnings and revenues relative to their share prices.
Apple’s has recovered over the past year amid better iPhone sales and “positive catalysts on the horizon,” Kessler said, while Microsoft’s LinkedIn acquisition and move away from mobile phones may be benefitting the stock. Companies like Google and Facebook are investing aggressively in what’s next, Kessler said, as evidenced by Facebook’s futuristic
Companies like Amazon have also changed the relationship between companies and shareholders, NYU Professor Scott Galloway argued in a talk last week, by emphasizing “fast growth and strong vision” above profits.
“In part because they are big, they can make these kinds of investments,” Kessler said. “The other subtext clearly is because they are the biggest, you get a disproportionate amount of passively allocated money, and there are benefits to that as well. ... I think these companies have done well by all accounts. People are encouraged by their results.”
Trends like cloud computing, the growth of the internet, the penetration of tech into new areas are “real tangible drivers” that can drive results for the companies, said Spencer of T. Rowe Price. Plus, the technology companies came out of the 2008 financial crisis better than many companies, thanks to consolidation during the dot-com bust, Spencer said.
“I think it is a time to be a bit more selective with your stock-picking,” Spencer said. “The round numbers [like 6,000] are interesting of course, but the company by company stock prices are really what drive our performance...The last time [the Nasdaq] hit 5,000, back the tech bubble — coming out of that, I really think it was good for tech to go through that period. It really led to a lot of rationalization and companies being leaner.”

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comThe “serious pain” seen across the stock market, especially in the technology sector, might be “horrifying,” but it shouldn’t discourage investors from starting to look for opportunities among the tech plays, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite
fell 1.25 percent in Thursday’s trading, briefly entering correction territory intraday. Wednesday marked the worst day of trading for tech stocks in seven years, with the Nasdaq plunging over 4 percent.
“Many of these stocks were up dramatically for the year, and when you get this kind of pullback, it typically does more damage to the winners,” Cramer explained.
“People are justifiably nervous about giving back their gains, too — and they have some outsized ones, particularly the big growth managers — and when they see this kind of sell-off, they sell hand over fist so they don’t lose their year[ly gains],” he said.
But investors who are interested in bottom-fishing have to keep an even keel if they want to preserve their portfolios, the “Mad Money” host said.
“If you want to pick among the rubble, you need to take your emotions out of the equation. You need to be clinical, you need to be rigorous, [and] you need to be empirical,” he said. “I want you to take a deep breath — do some yoga, even — and ... set some downside targets. Find a predetermined level where you think your favorite tech stocks would be worth buying and then wait for them to come to you.”
When Cramer reviewed some of the hardest-hit names in the Nasdaq 100
, an index containing the stocks of the 100 biggest non-financial companies in the Nasdaq, seven key tech stocks caught his eye: Autodesk
, Idexx Laboratories
, Amazon
, Take-Two Interactive Software
, Intuitive Surgical
, Expedia
and Intuit
.
All seven are “high-quality growth stocks that are all riding powerful secular trends,” but their stocks are down between 11 and 16 percent just for the month of October, he said.
“You can start buying one of these tomorrow. Pick at it, alright? Don’t buy all at once,” Cramer suggested. “Why these? Because they all just reported great quarters or have been on a roll, yet their stocks are getting crushed as if they’re doing poorly. We aren’t guessing with these. We know the last data points are positive, so that is the best place to go.”
As for the rest of the tech sector, the “Mad Money” host preached patience, warning that jumping in too soon could put investors in the “house of pain” as the sell-off continues to run its course.
“At the end of the day, there’s simply no rush to buy most of the tech stocks,” he explained. “These companies don’t start reporting for another couple of weeks, so unless the market rebounds pretty dramatically, ... you can afford to take your time here.”
But even though most tech plays don’t have protection from dividend yields and are likely trading at inflated levels, they do get less pricey as they fall, meaning more bargains could be on the horizon, Cramer said.
“The bottom line? The tech breakdown has been agonizing,” he said. “But for the higher-quality names like Autodesk, Idexx, Amazon, Take-Two, Intuitive Surgical, Expedia and Intuit, I say nibble right into the weakness. Buy some tomorrow morning. Just, please, don’t put all of your cash to work at once, because we don’t know if the pain is actually over.”CNBC’s Jim Cramer recommends seven technology stocks to investors as the stock market continues its multi-day losing streak.
One of the hardest-hit sectors has been technology, but secular growth could save some of the underlying stocks, the “Mad Money” host says."
"Nasdaq dips into correction territory, becoming first major stock benchmark to do so",EDT-20189:21-AM,"The Nasdaq Composite Index
on Thursday became the first major U.S. stock market benchmark to dip into a correction, dragged down by losses across all the major technology-related companies.
A correction on Wall Street is defined as down more than 10 percent from its high. The Nasdaq closed down 1.3 percent at 7,329.06. The technology-based index fell as low as 7,274 in intraday trading, down more than 10 percent from the most recent 52-week trading high of 8,133.30.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have further to fall to be in a correction with both down about 6 percent from recent all-time highs.
Amazon
, Netflix
and Alphabet
are all in correction territory after taking big hits this week. Rising interest rates are hitting the whole stock market this week, but especially tech stocks as investors worry their rich valuations won’t be justified in a higher interest rate environment. These names are also the biggest winners this year and during the whole bull market so some investors may be taking profits amid the broader market sell-off.
Micron and Tesla are off 35 percent from their 52-week highs. Facebook has fallen more than 30 percent. Netflix is down by 25 percent from its high and down nearly 10 percent this week alone. Amazon is off 17 percent from its high and by nearly 10 percent this week alone.

Nvidia, Intel, Alphabet are also all down more than 10 percent from one-year highs.
Many of those stocks were higher as trading began Thursday, but dropped again as the massive selling returned to the Street.

"Nasdaq drops more than 1%, enters correction territory as regulation fears batter big tech",EDT-20194:15-PM,"—CNBC’s Sam Meredith contributed to this report.Trade worries also weighed on the broader market.
Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said in a white paper Sunday that Washington would not be able to use pressure to force a trade deal on Beijing. He also refused to say whether the leaders of both countries would meet at the G-20 summit to work out an agreement later this month.
Wang added: “The U.S. has backtracked, and when you give them an inch, they want a yard.”
The remarks from Wang follow a month of heightened trade tensions between the world’s largest economies. The U.S. hiked tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods in May. China retaliated with higher tariffs on U.S. imports.
“This issue with China continues to be the big elephant in the room,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “If the two sides, China and the U.S., break down on these negotiations, we could see a 10% correction. We’re more than halfway there already and talks haven’t broken down yet.”
“There just aren’t a lot of things out there to drive the market so this issue continues to be the pivotal point,” Frederick said.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. note yield fell  its lowest level since September 2017. Gold prices climbed to their highest point since late March, breaking above $1,320.
Trade worries also rattled Wall Street last week after President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 5% charge on all imports from Mexico. The threat sent stocks tumbling on Friday.
U.S. manufacturing activity in the U.S. fell last month to its slowest pace of growth since October 2016, according data from the Institute for Supply Management. The pace of expansion also disappointed economists polled by Refinitiv. 
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Monday that a rate cut “may be warranted soon” given the risks of rising trade tensions.Tech stocks fell on Monday, June’s first day of trading, amid reports that the U.S. government is planning to target a host of big companies in the industry with antitrust and business practice probes. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Apple all weighed on the market during Monday’s session.
The Nasdaq Composite
dropped 1.6% to enter correction territory, closing more than 10% below its record high set in late April at 7,333.02. The  slid 0.3% to 2,744.45 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average
 ended the day just above breakeven at 24,819.78.
Alphabet shares pulled back 6.1% after reports said the Justice Department is preparing to launch an antitrust probe on Google. Meanwhile, Facebook dropped 7.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Federal Trade Commission would be able to look into Facebook’s practices and how they impact digital competition.
“The whole component of what’s going on in tech right now goes back to the rhetoric of Sen. Elizabeth Warren threatening to break up tech giants,” said Jeff Kilburg, CEO of KKM Financial. “We thought that was just rhetoric. But now with this news hitting, it’s really impactful.”
Amazon shares fell 4.6% after The Washington Post said an arrangement between the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department put the e-commerce giant under the FTC’s microscope. Apple also slipped 1% after Reuters reported the Justice Department received jurisdiction to investigate the company’s practices. 
Communications services, consumer discretionary and tech were the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500 on Monday. Communications dropped more than 2.5%, its biggest one-day drop since late October, while consumer and tech both closed more than 1% lower.
“With the trade stuff going on, [big tech] has been a bit of a hiding place,” said Christian Fromhertz, CEO of The Tribeca Trade Group. “You just can’t hide right now.”"
"The Nasdaq 100 just broke a historical win streak, here’s what could likely happen next",EDT-201710:53-AM,"The Nasdaq 100
broke a historical win streak, and according to one technical analyst, investors may have to brace themselves for a possible correction.
Tuesday on CNBC’s “Futures Now,” Pension Partners’ director of research, Charlie Bilello, pointed out that the Nasdaq 100 had been trading above its 50-day moving average for 138 consecutive trading days, which is the index’s longest win streak above that trend line ever. But Bilello also mentioned that it didn’t change the fact that “some signs of potential weakness” were creeping up in the market.
“We’re looking at things like the yield curve aggressively flattening, we’re looking at inflation expectations falling and we’re starting to see some weakness in the credit markets,” he said. “Within the Nasdaq 100 we’re seeing the semiconductor stocks, which have been the leaders for a long time now, starting to weaken.”
At Tuesday’s close, it seemed that some of those signs played out and dragged the Nasdaq 100 below that 50-day moving average, breaking the streak. Later that day, Bilello put out a note detailing what usually occurs when such a streak in the index breaks.
“Most of the time, there’s a pullback or correction, which is followed shortly thereafter by new highs,” he wrote. “We saw this in 2011, 2003, 2014, 2006, and 2007. In 2005, a deeper correction ensued which took some time (11 months) to reach new highs again.”
In other words, it’s likely that a correction is coming, though Bilello thinks the time frame for that is unclear. But history also suggests that the correction will likely be followed by new highs.
The Nasdaq 100 rebounded and opened higher on Wednesday morning, and the index is still up 14 percent year to date. But the Nasdaq 100 is still tracking for its first losing month since October."

Nasdaq set to power new Polish trading system,EDT-201710:06-AM,"The Polish Power Exchange (TGE), a commodity exchange in the eastern European nation, is to launch a new trading platform provided by the American stock exchange Nasdaq.
The third-party financial technology (fintech) deal gives extra revenue to Nasdaq for sharing its X-Stream Trading technology and installation expertise, and gives new functionality to TGE.
The deal gives TGE the ability to offer new commodity and derivative instruments later this year when the system goes fully live. It will comply with all relevant European regulation and hopefully attract new market participants.
Nasdaq claims its matching engine, which matches buy and sell instructions, is the most widely-used worldwide. It processes orders at the rate of 100,000 orders per second at TGE at an average latency speed of sub-40 microseconds. Speed is crucial on all exchanges as prices fluctuate so quickly.
The trading platform will be fully implemented by July 2017 when the second phase of the project will launch. This will enable the operation of a cross-border, day-ahead electricity trading market that can cater for interconnection auctions under the European Market Coupling regulatory mechanism. This regulatory initiative is intended to encourage more cross-border electricity trading in a European Union (EU) internal market in a fair manner that sells the electricity and interconnection transmission capacity together.
TGE, which is controlled by the state-run Warsaw Stock Exchange, can operate as an approved coordinating exchange under the new rules and with its attendant new trading system.
The first stage of installation, going live now, provides multi-market modeling support across a range of order and asset types, plus enhanced data processing capabilities, index calculation, risk management, control and supervision functionality. Extra market maker support and execution technology is included to enable users to easily run derivative market strategies.
Nasdaq and TGE have partnered on technology since 2008 but this new project offers improved commodity and derivative instrument trading capabilities.
The U.S. headquartered exchange and its fintech technology provision arm is also a partner to the Warsaw Commodity Clearing House (IRGiT), controlled by TGE, where it has been providing clearing services since June 2016.
Other global exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Group offer third-party fintech licensing deals for their data and execution trading systems. This supports the expense of developing such trading systems and provides an extra revenue stream separate to the small transaction fee that each exchanges takes. In recent years this traditional revenue has come under pressure from new market operators, necessitating diversification.
Nasdaq’s trading, real-time risk, clearing, central securities depository (CSD) and market surveillance systems can be packaged together or, in some cases, separated out depending on client demand. It has clients in over 100 marketplaces around the world.
Commenting on the deal, Dr Paweł Ostrowski, TGE’s president of the management board, said: “The implementation of a modern comprehensive trading system in cooperation with a proven partner marks a crucial business development step for us and participants of the markets operated by the exchange.”
“The latest technology will allow us to face European regulatory challenges and offer the necessary flexibility in shaping our future offering,” he added, while extolling the enhanced portfolio management options for end users and the buy and sell instruments now available at TGE.

Nasdaq and S&P 500 fall as Netflix leads steep tech sell-off,EDT-20185:41-PM,"“This is putting pressure on the rest of the world to come to terms with Trump’s demands for fairer and more bilateral trade. The risk is that Trump’s policies may be causing a widespread emerging markets crisis,” Yardeni said in a note.
Emerging-market stocks fell broadly on Wednesday as investors fretted over the dire state of the Argentine and Turkish economies. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund (EEM) dropped more than 1 percent.
Emerging markets have also been under pressure lately as the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, which have partly boosted the dollar, and as the Trump administration takes a more protectionist approach to trade.
“There is a clear level of trepidation in overseas economies as we await more news on trade, particularly tomorrow from our administration and what they will announce about the possibilities of new tariffs,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
The Trump administration could impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods as early as this week, according to reports. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China kept a lid on stock gains for most of the year as investors assessed their potential impact on the global economy.“The threat of tech being the target of regulation is real,” said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. “But we have had a pretty good run up in tech. I think what you’re getting here is a rotation out of tech and into some of the other names that have lagged.”

“We saw no volatility for 18 months until the first week of February,” said Rich Guerrini, CEO of PNC Investments. “We were all sort of numb to it. All of the sudden, we have to get used to volatility again.”
Stocks traded sharply lower earlier in the session on fears that President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs on steel and aluminum could spark a trade war. Domestically-oriented companies in industries like health care would be among the least affected by a trade war.
Trump made the announcement on Thursday, saying the U.S. will implement a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports next week. The news sent stocks reeling, with the Dow closing 420 points lower, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped more than 1 percent. It also raised concern that other countries may implement retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.
“The tariff announcement that was made is being considered to be a lot more serious than people were expecting,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. “Many people thought this would be more targeted. Instead, it’s like hitting something with a blunt instrument.”
Shares of steel and aluminum users like General Motors and Boeing fell 1 percent and 1.4 percent on Friday, extending Thursday’s losses of 4 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. Harley-Davidson also slipped 2 percent.

S&P 500 and Nasdaq snap 4-day losing streak as tech shares rebound,EDT-20184:14-PM,"“Selling pressure has been exacerbated by the concentration of high momentum technology stocks in a multitude of exchanges traded funds,” said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics, in a note. “Once the sell orders come in from trend followers, these ETFs must sell all the stocks in the basket, regardless of fundamentals or liquidity.”
Chaikin also said, however, these pullbacks are buying opportunities for investors. “While it is true that trees don’t grow to the sky, most of the leaders in the tech sector such as Adobe (ADBE), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Visa (V) are in the midst of a robust revenue and earnings surge.”
Regardless, Amazon and Apple both fell. Amazon declined 0.7 percent, posting its four-day losing streak since December 2017. Apple dropped 1.3 percent after President Donald Trump pressured the company to make its products in the U.S.
Worries around global trade also remain. Canada and the U.S. have yet to secure a final deal that would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump also told reporters last week the U.S. and Japan had begun talks over trade.
Trump also said Friday that he was “ready to go” on hitting China with an additional $267 billion worth of tariffs. The U.S. administration is already looking into finalizing plans that would inflict tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, after a public comment period expired recently.
The Trump administration’s trade policies — along with tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve — have pushed the dollar higher this year, causing problems for overseas economies, especially emerging markets. 
The dollar is up more than 3 percent in 2018 while the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) has dropped 12 percent. Many emerging-market economies are export-based, so tighter trade conditions and a stronger dollar pressures them. EEM fell 1 percent on Monday.
But strategists at MRB Partners think the dollar’s rally should lose steam in the near future. In a note, they said: “The dollar is nearing an overbought level, and both sentiment and net speculative long positions are already elevated. The good news is priced” in.
“Continued dollar strength would persist only in the circumstances of a further deterioration in global growth conditions, which we do not foresee,” MRB strategists said.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose slightly on Monday, snapping a four-day losing streak, as tech shares tried to regain some of the steep losses from last week.

slipped 59.47 points to close at 25,857.07, however, as Apple lost more than 1 percent. Transports, meanwhile, rallied 1.8 percent to an all-time high.
Tesla shares rose 8.5 percent after an analyst at Baird said investors should buy them “even with drama.” The analyst cited the potential of Tesla’s “Gigafactory” to give the company a competitive advantage long-term.
Technology stocks dropped nearly 3 percent last week as investors grappled with the possibility of stronger regulation for social media companies.
The Justice Department said last week Attorney General Jeff Sessions will meet with state attorneys general later in September to discuss worries surrounding tech companies that “may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.”
Semiconductor stocks rose, cutting losses from last week. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) dropped 2.9 percent last week.

The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 lost 5.2 percent on the week, while the Nasdaq shed 5.1 percent as rising interest rates spooked investors. The Dow experienced two drops of more than 1,000 points and two gains of more than 300 points during the volatile week.
Elsewhere, International Monetary Fund Director Christine Lagarde said the sell-off was not something to worry about. In fact, Lagarde said the view of the Washington-based IMF was that last week’s losses were a “welcome correction.”To the contrary, said influential banking analyst Dick Bove. “The United States equity markets has been captured by out-of-control technological investment systems,” he says in a commentary Monday on CNBC.com.The frenzied market sell-off last week was driven by human emotion and not algorithm-based trading, according to the CEO of the Nasdaq

“The foundation of the market movements we have seen over the last several days has been through human emotion,” Adena Friedman told CNBC at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Monday.
At their lows, all three major U.S. indexes slumped into correction territory last week after hitting record highs in January. Financial analysts have long warned that the rocketing bull market would at some point come to a screeching correction thanks to its highly overvalued stock prices. It appears last week was the first sign of that, though experts are divided over whether the market will sink further.
Meanwhile, as more and more transactions are made through algorithm trading — also known as algo trading — some strategists have argued that the sell-off could have been prompted by technical mechanisms.
When asked whether it was safe to say humans — and not algorithms — were still in control of market, Friedman replied: “I think humans are definitely in charge of the decisions in the market. I think that the way that the algorithms are written is basically on the back of a human decision.”“The foundation of the market movements we have seen over the last several days has been through human emotion,” Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman tells CNBC.

"Ahead of Saudi Aramco IPO, Nasdaq CEO says massive companies could benefit from dual-listing",EST-20182:24-AM,"Another option is a Saudi listing alongside an international exchange. A domestic listing and a private sale to a strategic investor — possibly from Beijing — is a third possibility.
Indecision at the highest levels of Saudi Arabia’s government is reportedly playing a major role in holding up the planned flotation of the world’s largest oil producer.
Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the government in Riyadh, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion later this year. But the process has dragged on as key aspects of the share sale remain unsettled.Saudi officials claim preparatory work regarding the IPO has been completed but some key issues — such as where to list — rest with the government.

Ice Cube’s pro basketball league rings Friday’s closing bell at the Nasdaq ,EDT-20184:17-PM,"Lengendary producer, actor and musician Ice Cube and entertainment executive, Jeff Kwatinetz ended the trading day by ringing the closing bell at the Nasdaq.
Ice Cube and Kwatinetz co-founded the basketball league, the BIG3, in 2017.  It’s a professional 3-on-3 league made up of former NBA players and coaches. 
The BIG3 is not in the same competition as the NBA mainly because the rules and format are drastically different. Games are 50 points, halftime takes place once a team reaches 25 points, and 4-point shots could be taken from different areas around the court.

Ex-Nasdaq CEO: ‘Impossible to believe that we don’t go into a real recession’ due to coronavirus,EDT-202012:25-PM,"The global economy will not be able to overcome the coronavirus outbreak’s hit to tourism and stave off recession, former Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld said Tuesday. 
“When you look at the real world, $8.8 trillion of the world’s global economy is tied to tourism — about 10%,” Greifeld said on CNBC’s “Squawk Alley.” “There’s no way that number holds up. So it’s impossible to believe that we do not go into a real recession. That will happen.”
Greifeld, now chairman of high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial,
estimated that the virus would wipe out about $4 trillion from the tourism industry. Fiscal stimulus by governments could help the industry but not keep it running at full speed, he said, leading to a big hit for the world economy.
“We never had this situation where you had tourism being such a large part of the global economy. That did not exist in years past. Tourism has increased greater than GDP growth for the past 10 years,” Greifeld said.
Former Wells Fargo
CEO Dick Kovacevich said later on “Squawk Alley” that he wasn’t certain that there would be a recession and thought that the fall-off in tourism wouldn’t be as impactful as Greifeld expected.
“I think there will be a substitute for people doing other things. Maybe not using an airplane but using their car and so on. I don’t think that money is going to go all in to savings accounts,” Kovacevich said. “What I’m really more concerned about is what happens to the jobs market if tourism shuts down.”
Shares of major airlines and cruise companies have cratered since the coronavirus outbreak as countries around the world have implemented travel restrictions to try to prevent the spread of the virus. Falling travel demand has already led major airlines to slash flights from their upcoming schedule and offer customers more flexibility in scheduling flights. 
Greifeld expects that once consumer confidence rebounds any recession recovery would be mostly “V-shaped,” suggesting a quick slide down but a quick bounce back up.
“There will be a lag factor. People will have to have data that says this thing is under control ... and then they’ll evolve into normal behavior. But that can happen in a relatively safe period of time,” he explained.“We never had this situation where you had tourism being such a large part of the global economy,” Bob Greifeld told CNBC on Tuesday.

Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said in a note forward earnings are also on the rise. “Momentum remains strong, as the yearly change in forward earnings is up from six-year lows in early 2016 and should accelerate in 2018,” he said.
Wall Street also looked to Washington as a three-day government shutdown concluded. During Monday’s session, members of the Senate managed to secure a temporary arrangement to keep the U.S. government open until February 8. The vote propelled the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to all-time highs.
The chamber passed a stopgap bill by a margin of 81-18. Members of the House later passed the bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump.
John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said the market viewed the shutdown “as a politics issue, not an economic issue.”
Equities are off to a strong start for the year, with the three major indexes rising at least 6 percent in January. Stocks are building on the strong gains made in 2017.
The stock market’s rise may not be over either, according to Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio. In an interview with CNBC, Dalio said the U.S. tax-code changes could lead to big gains in equities. “There is a lot of cash on the sidelines. ... We’re going to be inundated with cash,” he said. “If you’re holding cash, you’re going to feel pretty stupid.”

Tilray joins Nasdaq in first US cannabis IPO,EDT-20182:28-PM,"Tilray’s IPO may come on the heels of the U.S. listings of Cronos and Canopy, but Beacon Securities analyst David Kideckel said he doesn’t think there will be a mad dash among Canadian companies to follow suit.
The majority of Canadian cannabis companies “are public already on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange. It is possible they will apply for a dual listing, but the number of Canadian companies going to a direct listing it is hard to say,” Kideckel said. “The number of private companies are limited.”
American companies, however, still struggle to gain the financial benefits and credibility that come with going public on a major U.S. exchange.
Stock exchanges have stringent requirements for companies looking to list, including restrictions on those that have broken federal law. That means companies based in countries where marijuana is legalized like Canada may meet listing requirements in America, while their U.S.-based counterparts cannot.
U.S. marijuana companies are allowed to list on Canadian exchanges, so long as they fully disclose all risks to investors. But Canada’s largest exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, has forbidden it. The world’s ninth-largest exchange announced in October that U.S. cannabis companies cannot meet listing requirements because they violate federal law in their home countries.Amid a big year in markets for cannabis companies, Canadian medical marijuana company Tilray made its debut on the Nasdaq on Thursday — becoming the first pure-play marijuana company to go public on a major U.S. exchange.
And Tilray President and CEO Brendan Kennedy told CNBC that the buzz around cannabis is only going to continue to grow.
“Eight years ago you would have seen 90 percent of the revenues in Colorado would have come from products that would be smoked,” Kennedy said Thursday on “Power Lunch.” “Today it’s about 40 percent. Long term, I think we’ll end up with smoking being about 10 percent [of cannabis consumption] and all the other products being 90 percent.”
In fact, Kennedy envisions a world where consumers can order their cannabis “as a beverage in a bar.”
“Instead of alcohol, they’ll have cannabis,” said Kennedy, who is also a member of Tilray’s board of directors. “And they’ll have a low, or no-calorie product with no hangover.”
Tilray offered 9 million shares of its Class 2 common stock, which kicked off trading Thursday morning at $23.05 per share under the symbol “TLRY.” The company said in an SEC filing in advance of the offering that it was looking to sell stock between $14 and $16 per share, which valued Tilray between about $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. The IPO priced at $17 a share late Wednesday.
Tilray cultivates, processes and distributes cannabis products to tens of thousands of medical marijuana patients across 10 countries, including Australia, Canada and Germany, through subsidiaries and agreements with pharmaceutical distributors. The company currently grows marijuana in both Canada and Portugal.
Currently, products are available in 10 countries on five continents. And Kennedy said his company’s customer base will only increase as “country after country around the world” seeks to legalize medical cannabis. He said the “shift away from an illicit market to legal market” would increase adult cannabis users globally from 3.5 million to about 40 million people, with other countries modeling Canada’s regulatory framework.
“What you’re starting to see in adult-use countries like Canada, is people will buy professionally branded, professionally packaged, tested products that are much safer than what’s available on the illicit market,” Kennedy said.
Tilray’s move from public to private follows in the footsteps of Canadian marijuana giants Cronos Group
and Canopy Growth
.

He also noted that, while these tariffs are aimed at several Chinese imports, “the mixture of goods is different from that of the first round of tariffs. Also, they don’t come into effect until August.”
The Chinese commerce ministry said Thursday that China has not been in touch with the U.S. about restarting trade talks, but noted that China does not want a trade war. A spokesman for the ministry said, however, China does not fear a trade war.
Last week, the U.S. slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods. China responded to the tariffs by imposing its own retaliatory levies on imports from the States.
Investors also shifted their focus toward earnings and data, taking a breather from trade war concerns. On the earnings front, Delta Air Lines reported better-than-expected quarterly results. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings to have grown by 20 percent on a year-over-year basis, according a FactSet forecast.

The Nasdaq vs. the S&P: Why one looks like a way better value,EDT-201610:51-AM,"The Nasdaq composite has just concluded its third consecutive week of losses, and at this point, the index looks to be more appealingly valued than the S&P 500, according to one investor.
“The thing is right now, the Nasdaq
actually looks attractive,” Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Investment Advisory, said Friday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch.” “We’re still looking at really good growth over the next 12 months, about 90 percent, and it’s trading at about 18 times [expected forward] earnings. It’s starting to look cheap.”
While the ’s price-earnings ratio is slightly lower, that index’s smaller earnings growth prospects mean that the Nasdaq looks preferable.
Over the past three weeks, the Nasdaq is down 3.7 percent, while the S&P 500 is off by less than 1 percent.
“Any time the Nasdaq goes below 18 [forward P/E], it’s been a really good buy for the past three years. Though these sell-offs could be really great buying opportunities, I’d let the sentiment keep rolling out. But if it goes a little farther, it’s time to buy,” she said.

However, Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, warns that the Nasdaq’s growth will ultimately be determined by the broader U.S. economic outlook, which doesn’t look particularly promising in her view.
“Every year we’ve started with expecting more out of earnings, more out of the economy, and ending up on a sour note at the end of each year,” she said Friday on “Power Lunch.” “We’re probably headed in that direction, and I think that’s what the market is reacting to at the Nasdaq; it’s reacting to a shift in sentiment that’s been continuing to shift.”
For that reason, the Nasdaq is not as cheap as it looks, in Sanchez’s view.
“We’re looking at probably ending the year at sub-2 percent growth for GDP for the U.S. That has an impact on your expectation for growth, generally. So is 18 times forward cheap? I think you’re going to have to calibrate that to what you’re expecting going forward.”

What the Nasdaq’s lag is telling us about the market,EDT-20163:00-PM,"Even as the and the Dow Jones industrial average
hit all-time highs yet again Wednesday, that third well-known index, the Nasdaq composite
, is lagging badly behind.
In fact, as of midday trading Wednesday, the Nasdaq would have had to rise more than 4 percent to retake the level it hit in July 2015 —which itself was only a smidge higher than the great tech bubble highs seen in early 2000.
This is clearly a reflection of the types of stocks that have been driving the market lately. While it would be incorrect to refer to the Nasdaq composite as a tech index, more than 40 percent of the weight of the index is indeed comprised of tech stocks. The second-largest weighting belongs to consumer services, and health-care stocks follow.
Unfortunately for the composite, information technology and health care have been the two worst-performing sectors in the this year, save for the financials. Meanwhile the best-performing sectors, the rate-sensitive telecom and utilities categories, have almost no weighting within the Nasdaq.
This explains why the Nasdaq composite is only narrowly in the green this year, while the S&P is up more than 5 percent.
More generally, it points to the somewhat restrained nature of the recent stock market rally. This is not a speculative, exuberant surge. It is a mild march higher that appears largely driven by falling bond yields, with some help from an energy rebound.
The million-dollar question now is whether the character of the rally is set to shift, helping more economically sensitive stocks to lead the market — and allowing the Nasdaq to join its more defensively weighted brethren.
Of course, a series of micro events could also spur such highs as well. Eddy Elfenbein of the Crossing Wall Street blog said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch” that Nasdaq records are likely in the weeks ahead, as Microsoft
and Apple
report earnings that could send tech stocks sailing."

Apple and Facebook are not surprising, as both companies had solid fourth-quarter earnings reports. Apple, in particular, is up almost 9 percent since reporting earnings on Jan. 31. But Alphabet and Amazon are also recovering after big drops on their earnings days.
There was one big exception in tech: Microsoft, which was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100. The company has given up most of its gains since its strong earnings report on Jan. 25.
Correction: This story was revised to correct that Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, NVIDIA, Intel and Cisco had the highest impact on the Nasdaq 100.The emerging conventional wisdom says that Silicon Valley is no longer top dog under the Trump administration.
A lot of employees and execs at big tech companies opposed Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, and more than 100 have filed suit against the president’s travel ban affecting people from seven majority-Muslim countries. Most of the news out of Silicon Valley has been about employee protests and angry people on Twitter criticizing execs who participate in the Trump administration in any way. Surely this can’t be good for business, right?

“The market is suffering from an extreme case of ‘FOMO’ — this is a clear case of ‘fear of missing out.’ Everyone wants to be in, and nobody wants to miss out,” Chantico Global CEO Gina Sanchez diagnosed Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
In other words, the string of positive sessions and the index’s striking 21 percent gain this year have led more and more investors to jump in.
“People feel comfortable buying tech stocks, and ultimately that’s what’s leading this market higher,” IITrader’s chief market strategist, Bill Baruch, said Thursday on “Trading Nation.” Investors “worry about selling out of good positions, so no one wants to sell, and people just keep buying higher.”
Yet there’s a downside to comfort that verges on complacency.
“Once the market does start to correct, you will see a big fear, and that’s going to overexaggerate a move to the downside,” Baruch added. He says he wouldn’t be surprised to see a 10 percent drop that brings the Nasdaq 100 back to its late March lows.
Sanchez made a similar point, saying that with valuations at their highest levels since the dot-com bubble, “we could definitely see a retracement of where we’ve been.”

“This is just another small way of showing how rare and strong the action has been so far in 2017,” Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
The tech-heavy index has gained nearly 26 percent year to date, on pace for its best year since 2013 and its sixth consecutive year of gains — the longest annual stretch since the run that ended in 1981.
Tech earnings continue to justify the strong moves, Detrick wrote in an email to CNBC, adding that the sector’s third-quarter earnings were up more than 20 percent versus 11 percent expected growth at the beginning of earnings season.
The Nasdaq’s string of record gains this year has come amid a historically calm period for equity markets.
In a sign of low volatility across the broader market, Detrick noted on “Trading Nation” that the as of Tuesday’s market close has gone 45 trading days without a half a percent drop on a closing basis. That would be the longest streak since 1968 without a 0.5 percent decline by the S&P 500.
“We continue to see these streaks of ‘least volatile’ since when? Since the ’60s. That was really the last time we saw a market this nonvolatile. And we continue to see it, again, a slow step higher is what we’ve been seeing all year, and it sure looks like it might continue here,” he said.
At this point, it appears weakness has completely fled the market as stocks grind higher.

Trump returned from his first trip overseas to deal with the fallout from reports that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a top adviser, discussed the potential to set up a “secret and secure communications channel” between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin.
Multiple news organizations also reported Wednesday Trump was expected to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. In a tweet, Trump said he would announce his decision on the accord “over the next few days.”

Crit Thomas, global market strategist at Touchstone Investments, said there are concerns the Federal Reserve may not be able to raise interest rates twice more, as it had previously forecast.
“A lot of people assumed they’d raise in June and September, but now I’m hearing it may be June and December. A lot of things are getting pushed back,” Thomas said. Also, “Treasurys are suggesting a much different environment” than stocks.
Treasury yields have fallen sharply from where they began trading in 2017. On Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year yield hovered near 2.19 percent; it began the year near 2.5 percent.
Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, said the pullback in equities on Wednesday and Tuesday is reflective of “a confluence of unfavorable factors.”
“There is little indication that the US economy will reach its 3% growth this year, reform of health care and taxes remains a dream, and there are no projects as destinations to accept a surge in infrastructure spending,” he said. “Inflation figures continue to run well below the Fed’s targets as we found out earlier this week.”
Also raising concerns about inflation was the Fed’s Beige Book — a summary of economic conditions in the U.S. by Federal Reserve district — which revealed “some districts noted falling prices for certain final goods, including groceries, apparel and autos.” The Beige Book was released Wednesday afternoon.The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq all closed lower on Wednesday after financials dropped 0.8 percent.

"ICO market ‘very young’ so we are still the best place to raise cash, Nasdaq exec says",EST-20175:00-AM,"Nasdaq markets are still the best place for a company to raise money despite the rapid rise of the initial coin offering (ICO) in the cryptocurrency world, the vice chairman of the U.S. stock exchange told CNBC on Tuesday.
Speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, Nasdaq Vice Chair Bruce Aust played down the threat of ICOs.
“We are a regulated market, I think that’s the difference between us and an ICO. And we’ll see at some point those markets become regulated and that will change everything,” Aust said.
“It’s very young and early stage and Nasdaq has always been at the forefront of helping companies raise capital, whether it be in the Nasdaq private market or through the Nasdaq public markets. So we believe that we are the market for companies to raise capital.”
An ICO is when a company issues a digital coin or token in exchange for a cryptocurrency in order to raise cash. The people who invest typically don’t get an equity stake in the company, but can trade the coin on an exchange or use it to do something with the company.
It bears some similarities to initial public offerings (IPO), where an investors buys shares in a company. But with an IPO, a person often has a stake in the company. Because of this, some have seen ICOs as a potential threat to the IPO model. But they remain unregulated.
The ICO market is still tiny compared to the IPO market. Companies have raised around $3.2 billion so far this year from ICOs, according to Coinschedule, a website that tracks this information. In comparison, companies have raised $126.9 billion via IPOs up to the end of the third quarter, a recent study by EY shows.
Many have also poured cold water on the fundraising method. Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told CNBC in a recent interview that ICOs are an “absolute scam.” And regulators in China and South Korea have slapped outright bans on ICOs. However, authorities in other jurisdictions, such as Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, are looking to bring ICOs into the regulatory fold.Nasdaq is still the best place to raise money despite the rise of ICOs, Bruce Aust, vice chair of the U.S. stock exchange, said

“The computer automates the man’s decision. It’s not the other way around. Yet,” he said.
Nasdaq on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates by a penny per share. Recent market volatility has helped and hurt Nasdaq, Greifeld said.

On Tuesday, the Nasdaq soared above 6,000 for the first time ever after solid quarterly earnings reports from several large-cap companies in addition to investors zeroing in on the potential release of an outline to tax reform.
The promise of a major tax overhaul and looser regulations by the president partly fueled stock market gains in the months after Trump’s election. Trump is expected to announce his tax plan later Wednesday.
Friedman’s comment came as the Nasdaq released its mixed first-quarter earnings results. The company posted $1.10 per share on revenue of $583 million. Wall Street expected earnings of $1.06 a share on revenue of $594.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.
Nasdaq also announced a 19 percent increase in its quarterly dividend to 38 cents and said it repurchased $156 million of its common stock in the first quarter.

DocuSign starts trading on Nasdaq after raising $629 million in IPO,EDT-20185:41-PM,"DocuSign
shares zoomed more than 30 percent higher on Friday in the stock’s first trading day on the Nasdaq.
Shares opened at $38 apiece, well above the $29 Thursday night pricing. The stock held gains through the day, closing at $39.73, up 37 percent.
The company, which makes software for digitally signing documents, raised $629.3 million in its initial public offering after pricing shares at $29. The move provides another proof point for continuing market interest in new technology stocks.
DocuSign’s S-1 filing, which initiates the process of going public, appeared online on March 28. On April 17 the company revised the filing and estimated that its stock would price between $24 per share and $26 per share. And on Wednesday DocuSign revised it again and bumped up the range to $26 per share to $28 per share.
The company is trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DOCU.”
DocuSign said Thursday that it sold 21.7 million shares of its stock and now has 152.1 million outstanding shares, giving the company an implied valuation of $4.41 billion, above the $3 billion valuation that it reportedly picked up in 2015.
CEO Dan Springer told CNBC that while the company has a history of operating losses, he was feeling “pretty good” about the company’s future profitability. The IPO money will be spent on doing the same things the company has done thus far, including “major investments” infrastructure and security, and in making the company a “the best place to work” to attract top talent, Springer told CNBC’s “Squawk Alley” on Friday. He also said there’s a huge opportunity for DocuSign in international expansion.

Here’s why more Nasdaq highs could be on the horizon,EDT-201611:23-AM,"The surging Nasdaq
composite is set to rise even higher over the next year, according to one bullish technical analyst.
“We’ve now got the Dow
, we’ve got the and now we’ve got the Nasdaq making all-time new highs,” Piper Jaffray technical analyst Craig Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch,” referring to each major index hitting new all-time highs in recent weeks.
While the Nasdaq opened a bit lower on Wednesday, the tech-heavy index on Tuesday hit its first record intraday high in more than a year.
“It looks like we’re making kind of a classic bottoming-type pattern — left shoulder, head, right shoulder. We broke it above the neckline,” he said, referencing a five-year weekly Nasdaq chart.

Johnson said this so-called “head and shoulders pattern” suggests further gains.
“I see more upside to the Nasdaq,” said Johnson, estimating a 12 percent rise from current levels over the next year.
The Nasdaq, which includes tech heavyweights like Amazon
, Apple
and Google
parent company Alphabet, rallied on the back of a stronger-than-expected jobs report released on Friday.
Not everyone is as bullish on the index, however.
“You look at February bottom; who bought that bottom? Really, when you start to look at these institutions, more of them are selling now, volume’s been light,” Steve Grasso, director institutional sales at Stuart Frankel, said Tuesday on CNBC.
Though he does not believe that Johnson’s forecast is unreasonable, he predicted that “you’re going to see a sell-off before we get another 12 percent higher in the indexes,” Grasso said."

Nasdaq to settle Facebook IPO lawsuit for $26.5M,EDT-20155:08-AM,"The settlement is significant because exchanges are responsible for policing their own markets and therefore are legally immune from private liability for damages incurred when they are performing regulatory functions like conducting an IPO.
“This is the first case that we are aware of where a class of investors has sued an exchange for market disruption, and the court has sustained those claims,” said Vincent Cappucci, one of the lawyers representing retail investors harmed in the IPO.
Facebook’s first day of trading on May 18, 2012, was rife with technology problems that resulted in a delayed opening and thousands of orders being stuck in Nasdaq’s system for hours. Market-making firms lost an estimated $500 million as a result, and in 2013, Nasdaq voluntarily repaid about $41.6 million to them.
But retail investors must use brokers to send orders to the exchange and were not able to apply for compensation.
Thursday’s settlement accounts for “a very favorable percentage” of the losses retail investors sustained, Cappucci said.
Still, the settlement should not have any effect on exchange immunity, Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld said in an interview.
Nasdaq said earlier on Thursday that it had set aside $31 million for litigation arising from Facebook’s IPO.
“We are just happy to be able to move on,” Greifeld said, adding that insurance would cover most, if not all, of the settlement.
The reserve will also cover expected costs of re-opening the voluntary compensation program for firms that did not submit a claim to Nasdaq in 2013.
UBS
’s market-making arm sued to recoup more than $350 million of losses from the IPO, rather than submit a claim to Nasdaq. In October, an appeals court rejected UBS’s bid bring Nasdaq to arbitration.
“We are happy that UBS is probably going to apply to become a part of the accommodation policy,” Greifeld said, “and we are certainly happy to open it up again for them.”

“While most tech names including FANG stocks are relatively insulated from any China worries/headwinds, this is enough of a near term concern for tech investors to take some profits after a golden run over the last few weeks with many of these names making new highs,” Ives said.

Politico also reported that the Trump administration is targeting $30 billion in Chinese imports, but noted the president asked for a bigger number.
Stocks initially rose on the back of data that showed U.S. inflation remained tame.
The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in February, in line with expectations. Inflation concerns permeated through the market last month as investors worried that higher inflation would lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy at a faster rate.
“Traders exhaled a sigh of relief, for combined with last week’s tepid wage growth data, nothing suggests that inflation has gotten to a point that forces the Fed to quicken its step down the path to normalization,” said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities.
“Nevertheless, the central bank will likely upgrade its near term outlook for the economy from ‘roughly balanced.’”
Stocks were coming off a mixed session in which the Nasdaq closed at a record while the Dow and S&P 500 fell amid trade-war worries.
Last week, Trump signed two declarations which would implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The tariffs are expected to take effect in the coming weeks and will see a 25 percent charge placed on steel, and 10 percent levy on aluminum — Canada and Mexico however are exempt.

The original support level near 1220 was tested and established between 2002 and 2009. The original resistance level near 1790 was established between 1198 and 2004. This was the first trading band.
The value of this trading band has been projected upwards to create a pattern of 7 equal-width trading bands. These have been remarkably accurate in defining breakout targets, and retracement support targets. The chart shows the last two of these trading bands.
The target 3 level of 5200 was achieved in July 2015. The retreat from this level used the 4620 level as a support level. The fall below this level has support near 4050. This creates a dual support level close the value of trend line A.
This analysis suggests a rally away from the support level near 4050 with a resistance target near 4620. A break above this level encounters resistance from trend line B.
This combination of resistance features from the two separate analysis methods makes it difficult for the NASDAQ to move above previous highs of 5200. However the pattern of features helps investors to establish the longer-term targets. It’s important to note that despite the pullback, the NASDAQ remains in a long term bullish pattern on the monthly chart.The monthly NASDAQ chart is relatively complex with two different levels of technical analysis. Combined, these two approaches provide a better understanding of the context of NASDAQ activity with downside and upside targets.
The first analysis method uses the long-term pattern of an up-sloping trading channel. The main channel is defined by trend lines A and B. The channel start in April, 2009. The NASDAQ traded inside this channel until the breakout above trend line B in October, 2013.
Between October 2013 and February 2016 the NASDAQ traded in the channel between trend line B and the projected value of trend line C. Trend line B acted as a support level. The width of this channel was the same as the width of the long-term trading channel."
"Nasdaq closes at record, Dow rallies more than 400 points after jobs report",EST-20187:51-PM,"U.S. stocks surged on Friday, pushing the Nasdaq composite
to a record, after February jobs growth far exceeded expectations.
The tech-heavy advanced 1.8 percent to 7,560.81 and hit intraday and closing records, erasing the losses from last month’s correction. The Nasdaq 100, which is made up of the 100 largest companies in the Nasdaq composite, also reached a record high. Friday marked the first time since Jan. 26 that either index reached a record high.
Shares of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google helped lead the gains.
The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 440.53 points to close at 25,335.74, with Goldman Sachs among the biggest contributors of gains to the index. The 30-stock index also closed above its 50-day moving average, a key technical level.
The gained 1.7 percent to end at 2,786.57, with financials as the best-performing sector. It also closed above its 50-day moving average.
“This jobs report was the perfect slice of pizza,” Kevin Mahn, president and chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh, told CNBC’s “Power Lunch” on Friday. “It did reaffirm the underlying strength of this economy, but it also diminished some of those inflationary concerns and the potential that there could be more than three rate hikes this year.”
The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by Reuters expected a gain of 200,000.
Wages, meanwhile, grew less than expected, rising 2.6 percent on an annualized basis. Stronger-than-expected wage growth helped spark a market correction in the previous month.
“As far as the market is concerned, you couldn’t have scripted it any better,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. But “it still remains a mystery how you can create these many jobs and not have wages go up more.”
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered to be the best gauge of fear in the market, hit its lowest level since Feb. 1 and traded more than 11.5 percent lower at 14.62.
A “solid jobs number with lower wage numbers has muted inflation concerns,” said Jeff Chang, managing director at Cboe Vest. “This has dampened the fears we saw in the equity markets early last month. With the VIX below 16, you could be seeing investors reducing their hedges to these concerns.”
The moves Friday came after Wall Street finished on a positive note on Thursday, following more developments concerning tariffs.
President Donald Trump signed two declarations on Thursday, which would implement tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The tariffs are expected to take effect in 15 days and will put a 25 percent charge on steel, and 10 percent on aluminum. Canada and Mexico however are exempt.
“I’m glad to see Canada and Mexico [were] spared in the latest tariff initiatives,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, in a note. “But, 75% of our trading partners were slapped. I get that China was the real target here but we import 13% of our steel from Brazil, 10% from South Korea, 5% from Japan, 4% from Germany and 3.5% from Taiwan to name some others.”
Friday also marked the nine-year anniversary of the bull market. It also marks the “Haines Bottom.” Before the open on March 10, 2009, CNBC anchor Mark Haines called the bottom of the financial crisis on air.
On March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 closed at 676.53. Since then, the S&P 500 is up around 300 percent. Consumer discretionary is the best-performing sector in that time period, rising more than 550 percent. A theoretical $10,000 bet on Amazon would be worth $250,000 today.
In corporate news, Goldman Sachs closed 1.7 percent higher after a report said CEO Lloyd Blankfein is preparing to leave the company by year-end.
Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters the company has “plenty of cash horsepower” to make acquisitions, such as the proposed tie-up with Brazil’s Embraer. Boeing shares rose 1.7 percent on Friday.

Stocks on Monday were mixed, with the Dow taking a break from an eight-session winning streak. It lost 15 points to 18,038. The other indexes were higher and the Dow utilities and Russell 2000 both set new highs. 
Some strategists are concerned the market’s December gains are stealing from next year, and January could be a rough month as a result.
Lee disagrees. “I think we’re going to start the year really strong. I know there’s a lot of headwinds. There’s oil and the capex implications of that. There’s Europe and now we have this Greek election,” said Lee. “I think they’re not big enough headwinds to offset the positives. We’ve got really good labor market momentum. Consumer spending is really, really strong, and there’s some comfort that the Fed is still going to be really supportive of the markets.”
As for economic data Tuesday, traders are watching S&P/Case-Shiller home prices at 9 a.m. ET and consumer confidence at 10 a.m. 
Traders are also watching oil prices. Energy stocks gained 0.3 percent even though oil futures declined.
Oil prices Monday fell to a new five-year low. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for February fell 2.1 percent to $53.61 per barrel. Brent was also sharply lower, despite an initial rally on concerns more supply will be disrupted from Libya.“I think that’s not going to be a problem for the Nasdaq to surpass its prior 2000 high. The quality of the companies are completely different today. They have a lot more earnings power. And the valuations are a lot more reasonable,” said Thomas Lee, co-founder and strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors.

Paul LaRosa, chief market technician at Maxim Group, said the action in the Nasdaq is important this week and it could be key for the market overall. He is watching to see if the Nasdaq can close above 4,810, its intraday high from Nov. 28, 2014. So far, the other major indexes—the Dow
, S&P 500 and Russell 2000
—have surpassed their recent highs and set new all-time highs. 
“At the very least, I want to see a close over 4,810 to confirm the other indices,” he said. “It could be a negative divergence.” LaRosa explained that a divergence occurs when there’s a rush of buying but one or two indexes do not follow. “Then there’s a big selloff. The more time it takes to close above it, the more likely there’s a correction.”
LaRosa said he’s surprised the Nasdaq has not surpassed its recent high already, and he noted his 12-month target has been at 5,100.

That type of 5 percent gain should not be difficult for the Nasdaq, given that a group of 15 top strategists surveyed by CNBC expect the S&P 500 to rise about 6 percent during 2015 from its current level of 2,090.

"As Apple and Facebook lead Nasdaq to a record, here are the next potential winners in the index",EDT-201710:44-AM,"The Nasdaq composite index
jumped to a record this week as technology stocks rebound from an initial underperformance following the election of Donald Trump.
There’s still an investment opportunity for traders to ride the comeback with biotech and other shares in the Nasdaq, based on consensus expectations from Wall Street analysts.
Year to date the Nasdaq composite is up about 5 percent, compared with a return of around 2 percent for the S&P 500 and a gain of 1.4 percent for the Dow.
“Tech is quickly becoming our favorite group as it has been left behind in the Trump bump,” Jefferies’ strategist Steven DeSanctis wrote in a note to clients at the end of December. “The sector is cyclical and so a faster economy in which rates rise helps this sector.”

"Top Nasdaq stocks in worst quarter in a decade, but one trader is betting on a short squeeze",EST-20187:05-AM,"The Nasdaq’s largest stocks have had a horrible two months.
The Nasdaq 100
, which contains heavyweights like Facebook
, Tesla
 and Alphabet
, is tracking for a 12 percent loss for the quarter, its worst quarterly performance in a decade.
Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, says that steep decline could inspire a spring higher.
“The market is set for a bit of a relief rally and I want to be positioned for this possible coming short squeeze,” Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” The QQQ ETF
, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, “has obviously gotten hammered here.”
The good news is that each sell-off has become less extreme, says Gordon, suggesting pressure on the index is abating.
“Momentum as measured by RSI, which is the relative strength index, has actually been decreasing on each push to new lows,” he said. “We saw a low RSI reading here on the initial push, we saw a second push but towards a higher low, and yet we saw a third push to an even higher low.”
“At some point sellers’ conviction will dry up. They will start to be afraid, shorts will start to cover, value shoppers come in and that’s how you engage the short squeeze,” said Gordon.
He anticipates a move higher to $168 to $171, implying 3 percent to 5 percent upside from current levels. To take advantage of that expected gain, he is buying the Dec. 21 $165 calls and selling the $168 calls, trading at $1.28 for a $3 spread. His maximum potential gain is $171.
“If the trade is going against you, cut it. So really we have about $60 of risk to potentially make $171, almost 3-to-1 reward-to-risk ratio, so certainly an attractive trade,” he said."
"Chart: Here’s why the Nasdaq will pass 5,200",EST-20153:00-AM,"The current Nasdaq movement is a steady uptrend moving in a well-defined trading channel that is best seen on a monthly chart. The up-move started in March 2009 and has moved steadily upwards in a sustained six-year uptrend kept within the confines of a upwards-sloping trading channel, or rising trend channel.
The lower edge of the trend channel is shown by trend line A. The upper edge of the channel is shown by trend line B. In November 2013 the Nasdaq moved above the value of trend line B and now uses this trend line as a support level. Support was successfully tested in August, September and October.
A second trend channel can be calculated using the width of the channel between lines A and B. The upper edge of the new trend channel is shown with line C, which acts as a resistance level for the rising trend.
The Nasdaq trend moves up in a series of horizontal trading bands. The width of the trading band is measured and this value is projected upwards to give the new upside trading target. Using this method, the breakout above 4,640 has an upside target near 5,200. A move above 5,200 has a target near 5,800, and the 5,800 target is the long-term target for 2016.
There are three significant patterns that indicate a major trend change. The first of these patterns is the head and shoulder pattern. The second is the rounding top pattern. The third is a blow-off top pattern that follows a period of extreme upwards momentum.
None of these three trend reversal patterns currently appear on the Nasdaq chart, which indicates there is a low probability of a change in the trend direction. The rally towards 5,200 is a buying opportunity for a trend continuation towards 5,800.After a retreat of around 12 percent, the Nasdaq has rebounded strongly from the long-term uptrend support line and is moving to retest the upside target near 5,200 points.
This is the second time the Nasdaq has moved towards the 5200 technical target and many investors are worried that these new highs signal the end of the uptrend. This is where chart analysis is invaluable.
Chart analysis gives investors a method to decide if the rally towards 5,200 is a buying opportunity or a sell signal.
In 2000, the rise of 247 percent from 1,475 to 5,132 over seven months was unsustainable. The Nasdaq trend was almost vertical from November 1999 until the crash in March 2000.

The chance to get on Nasdaq 100 was a selling point for Facebook itself. In the lead-up to the Facebook IPO, Nasdaq reduced the amount of time a qualifying firm needs to be listed on Nasdaq in order to be added in the index to three months from a year.
Alibaba doesn’t qualify to be on many of the world’s major indices, since it is registered in the Cayman Islands. The behemoth S&P 500 Index, which has a market capitalization of $18.6 trillion, only lists U.S. companies.
The Chinese firm is not eligible to be part of the biggest MSCI or FTSE indices for other reasons, although MSCI is looking at changing its index rules in a way that could put Alibaba on a major index.
And finally, Alibaba gave up a chance for mainland Chinese to invest, since China-based money manager Guotai Asset Management’s Guotai Nasdaq 100 Index trades on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
“It falls into this no man’s land of indexing,” said Dennis Hudachek, a senior ETF specialist with ETF.com, an expert on exchange-traded funds.
—By ReutersNasdaq systems buckled under the tremendous volume of orders on the first day of trading in Facebook’s shares in 2012, leading to hours of delay.
In its presentation to Alibaba, Nasdaq detailed the steps it had taken to prevent another Facebook-style glitch, two sources familiar with the pitch said. The exchange has said it responded to Facebook by putting extra safeguards in place, creating new positions within the company to improve communications with the industry and regulators when errors occur, and establishing an engineering team to monitor and analyze daily performance.
Index fund bedrock
The decision not to go with Nasdaq meant that Alibaba may not join any major global index this year.
“There is a pretty strong argument that index inclusion equals stability,” Kevin Landis, chief investment officer of Firsthand Capital Management, a Silicon-Valley-based technology-investing specialist with $400 million in assets under management.
ETFs and mutual funds that track such benchmarks have to buy and hold their stock.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes companies such as Apple
and Google

Funds such as the $46.8 billion QQQ PowerShares exchange-traded fund, the fifth-biggest ETF in the world, track the Nasdaq 100, according to data from Thomson Reuters’ Lipper service.Nasdaq tried to persuade Alibaba that it had fixed the problem, the sources said, but it is not clear whether they were swayed.
One of the sources said that Alibaba eventually was satisfied that Nasdaq had solved the issue and chose NYSE
because its overall pitch was better. The other said Nasdaq executives believed that Alibaba decided that the possibility of a botched IPO, however small, outweighed the possible benefits of being in the index.
Alibaba and NYSE declined to comment, while a spokesman for Nasdaq, which has repeatedly said it has fixed the issues that went wrong in the Facebook IPO, said “It was a close race, and we wish Alibaba well.”
Alibaba’s misgivings about Nasdaq’s technology, two years after Facebook’s glitch-ridden, $16 billion market debut, show the incident continues to threaten Nasdaq’s reputation.

The Nasdaq has changed fundamentally since 2000, Sherlund added. “Valuation underpinning looks very different. The composition of the Nasdaq looks very different.

The rally in the shares of Apple—which has jumped nearly 68 percent over the last 12 months, including a 16.7 percent gain for the year to date—is likely to push the Nasdaq to new records, fund managers say.
“You have the largest company in the world continuing to grow at above-market rates, which is incredible,” said Aylesworth, the Hennessy manager.
Apple represented slightly over 10 percent of the Nasdaq’s market value as of Wednesday’s close. At its record high in 2000, Apple made up less than 0.2 percent of the index. At the time, company co-founder Steve Jobs was just three years into his second go-round as its chief executive, and the company was still a year away from introducing the iPod digital music player.
Despite its growth rates, Apple still trades at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 17.3, in line with the broad S&P 500 index, and pays a dividend yield of 1.4 percent.
Apple’s outsized presence in the Nasdaq—along with that of Google
, a company that was still private 15 years ago and now constitutes about 4 percent of the index—is one sign that the technology sector has matured, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.
“It’s taken fifteen years for the Nasdaq to grow into something rational,” he said.Should the Nasdaq set a new record soon, as many expect—the index remains about 4 percent below its highest point after gaining nearly 15 percent over the last 12 months—its catalyst won’t be irrational exuberance, fund managers and analysts say.
Instead, three key factors underpin the Nasdaq’s 125 percent rise over the last five years: the Federal Reserve’s ongoing policy of near-zero interest rates that has made equities more attractive than bonds; the maturation of technology companies; and the rise of Apple
, a company that didn’t appear among the largest 20 companies by market value in the index 15 years ago and now represents more than 10 percent of its weight.
Bubble questions
The Fed’s policy of keeping short-term interest rates near zero is credited with pushing up the prices of stocks and real estate broadly over the last five years. Yet fund managers say that they see few signs of a bubble in technology stocks, at least for now.
“Because the Federal Reserve has waited so long to get rates back to normal, it’s almost set up to fuel a bubble,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. “But my sense is that there’s still a nervousness about the U.S. equity market and it’s been keeping a lid on valuations getting out of hand.”

The pace of new initial public offerings has slowed considerably from the 630 tech IPOs that came to market between 1999 and 2000, leading to less speculation overall. By comparison, 299 companies overall went public between the start of 2014 and the year to date, according to Renaissance Capital. Technology companies make up 43 percent of the Nasdaq.
Back then, companies routinely went public with little more than a concept. Now, companies such as Uber, the popular ride-hailing service, have seen their valuations top $40 billion in the private markets, in part because mutual fund firms are more willing to take stakes in early-stage companies.As the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index closes in on the all-time high it reached in March 2000, investors are facing a market that barely resembles the go-go era of 15 years ago.
Valuations, as measured by what investors are willing to pay for the last 12 months of earnings, are an eighth of what they were at the peak of the dot com bubble, when the Nasdaq hit an intraday record of 5,132 before falling more than 63 percent in 12 months.

A rare glimpse into how Nasdaq polices markets,EST-20151:03-PM,"Nasdaq has never allowed a reporter into the facility, but granted CNBC rare all-day access to see how its analysts police the markets in real time.
“Our goal here is to find bad behavior, but it’s also to deter bad behavior,” said Ed Knight, Nasdaq’s executive vice president and general counsel. “People need to know that we have the best people and in my view the best technology.”

The integrity of American stock markets has been in focus over the year since Michael Lewis published his book “Flash Boys,” starting a national debate over whether some high speed trading abuses meant the markets are “rigged.”
High-frequency trading is one part of what Nasdaq is monitoring in Rockville, and the exchange boasts that it can rewind trades at “the finest gradation of time imaginable” to watch trading, using what Nasdaq says are more than 200 technology patents to check the activity.
But analysts are also looking at more old fashioned fraud, and they run background checks on executives and board members of Nasdaq-listed firms looking for officials who have been involved in fraud or improper activity.

Nasdaq says it processes 4 billion messages each day at the Maryland facility, using computer algorithms that analyze 35,000 parameters in real time, sending alerts to human analysts for review within two seconds of the unusual trades.
They’re also monitoring Twitter and real time news events, and then running back the trading ahead of announcements to watch for patterns of insider trading.
“We’re looking for abnormal behavior, something might indicate insider trading, something that might indicate manipulation of the market. We investigate that,” said Knight. “And if we feel that it needs to be further investigated we referred to FINRA or to the SEC for further work.”
In 2014, Nasdaq says it flagged 766 incidents that were suspicious enough to refer to federal regulators. Officials say that regulators have moved forward on a wide range of cases that have resulted in fines and penalties for market participants.
Here are few cases involving the facility:
—A $9.5 million fine in July 2013 for brokerage and clearing firm Newedge USA for supervisory, books and records violations.
—A $1.145 million fine in May 2013 against HAP Trading for engaging in “cross product manipulation” to create false prices in securities and options.
—A $2 million fine in 2009 against Citigroup for erroneous publication of quotes, audit trail violations of trade orders and other failures.
But there’s much that Nasdaq can’t do from its market watch facility, including monitor trading in so-called dark pools, those private trading venues that have become a large venue for stock sales. “Right now, it is very lightly regulated and it’s subject to potential abuse,” Knight said. “We think it can be improved. We think more of that trading can be handled with tighter regulation.”
And Nasdaq also can’t see trading on other exchanges unless they specifically request it—although officials say that the coming consolidated audit trail will give them more timely information.Tucked into a nondescript corporate office park in suburban Rockville, Maryland, is an unusual high-security operation: the Nasdaq’s Market Watch facility, where teams of analysts are on duty 24 hours a day, monitoring global trading for hints of manipulation, high frequency violations or insider trading.
Although Nasdaq has its market site headquartered in New York’s Times Square, the exchange’s surveillance effort is based outside of Washington, D.C., for better access to the nation’s financial regulators at the SEC and FINRA, as well as for the local tech and legal workforce."
"Nasdaq CEO boasted of gaining top tech IPO, then lost it to NYSE",EDT-20157:01-AM,"Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld said in July he was delighted to have snared one of the hottest technology IPOs of the year. There was just one problem—the deal was not in the bag.
That became very apparent on Wednesday when the business technology startup Pure Storage said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would instead be listing on Nasdaq’s fierce rival, the New York Stock Exchange.
According to a source familiar with the matter, Greifeld angered Pure Storage’s top executives when he prematurely announced that the company was going to list, and that the mandate had gone to Nasdaq. Greifeld made the announcement on Nasdaq’s
second quarter earnings call.
Greifeld’s remark—“And we’re also very happy to win Pure Storage a week or so ago”—was made nearly a month before the company announced on Aug. 12 its intention to sell shares to the public.
Nasdaq declined to comment for this story.
It is not clear whether Pure Storage had signed any kind of agreement to list on Nasdaq, but the initial plan, before Greifeld spoke, was to go to Nasdaq, said the source, who declined to be identified.
Pure Storage and NYSE declined to comment.
Share listings are hotly contested by exchanges for the fees and revenue from trading they generate and for the marketing opportunities they provide.
A companys opening day on the exchange is a big publicity event and one high-profile listing can often lead to others.
Pure Storage’s IPO will be closely watched because a successful listing of the company, which was valued privately at over $3 billion in April, could encourage other similar technology firms to follow suit.
The company, founded in 2009, makes flash-based storage devices, which are typically much faster than storage that runs on hard disk drives. It competes with larger, established companies such as EMC Corp.
and NetApp

The company has raised over $470 million from venture capital investors including Sutter Hill, Greylock, Redpoint, Index Ventures, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity and Wellington Management."

“The economic data support the narrative that we have a solid fundamental backdrop,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. “What we need here is progress on the [Trump] agenda.”
President Donald Trump returned from his first trip overseas to deal with the fallout from reports that Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a top adviser, discussed the potential to set up a “secret and secure communications channel” between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin.
Stocks came into Tuesday’s session having posted strong gains in the previous week. Those gains propelled the S&P and Nasdaq indexes to record levels.
“What’s driving the market here is the fact that interest rates have been so low lately,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “Everyone thought interest rates were going up but the opposite has happened.”
The benchmark 10-year note yield began 2017 trading near 2.5 percent but hovered near 2.22 percent on Tuesday.
Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told CNBC on Tuesday he sees U.S. growth to remain near 2 percent and not the 3 percent or more forecast by President Donald Trump’s administration.
“Two things drive GDP: growth in the labor force and growth in productivity,” he said in a live interview on “Squawk Box.” “The problem is labor force growth is very sluggish. And my own judgment and our economists at the Dallas Fed think it’s going to continue to be sluggish the next 10 years because the population is aging and labor force growth therefore is slowing.”U.S. equities closed lower on Tuesday as investors digested key economic data, but a rise in tech stocks helped cap losses.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 50 points, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses.
The Nasdaq composite traded 0.1 percent despite shares of Amazon breaking above $1,000 for the first time. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1, with energy leading decliners, but the information technology sector rose 0.31 percent. Tech has been on fire this year, rising around 20 percent. Nevertheless, the Nasdaq and S&P snapped a seven-day winning streak.
“The large tech outperformance is a trend I wouldn’t fight right now,” said Mark Heppenstall, CIO at Penn Mutual Asset Management, but noted, “there’s a lot of good news priced into these stocks.”
U.S. stock markets were closed Monday because of the Memorial Day holiday.
Personal income rose 0.4 percent in April, in line with expectations, and consumer spending increased by 0.4 percent. The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.2 percent.
“The series stubbornly has not risen to anywhere near the FOMC’s preferred level of inflation. Despite ostensibly failing to satisfy half of its Dual Mandate, the central bank will have few problems progressing down the path to normalization,” said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities.
Meanwhile, U.S. home prices rose 5.8 percent in March, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.Tech’s rise Tuesday was not enough to keep the S&P and Nasdaq from snapping a seven-day winning streak.

Op-Ed: Bitcoin is more akin to the Nasdaq than gold and is not a safe haven asset,EDT-20174:47-AM,"It’s clear that investors are flocking to bitcoin, not because it offers stability, which it quite clearly doesn’t, but more to find solid returns on an asset that is up over 150 percent year-to-date.
Investors still believing bitcoin is a safe-haven asset might find themselves on the wrong side of the trade.
- Additional reporting my CNBC’s Seamus Conwell
For more insight from CNBC contributors, follow @CNBCopinion on Twitter.Buying the Nasdaq represents a risk-on move and I’d argue so does buying bitcoin, a currency that can see swings of over $100 in a few hours.
A look at bitcoin’s trading pattern versus gold in the last year also gives a glimpse into how the cryptocurrency isn’t really a safe haven asset. Gold saw a lot of support between mid-June of 2016 and the middle of October. Bitcoin was just bubbling along quietly. But once President Donald Trump was elected, investors moved out of gold into riskier assets on the promise that increased spending by the new U.S administration as well as tax reform could boost stocks. At the time the gold price continued to decline, bitcoin rose, and while the precious metal saw a bit of renewed support in the first few months, the cryptocurrency continues to skyrocket.“I wish I’d invested in bitcoin,” is a response I usually hear when I tell people how much they could have made off the cryptocurrency if they bought it at the start. Just to be clear, if you bought $100 worth of in 2010 when it was worth 0.003 cents each, you’d be sitting on over $88 million.
It all sounds so easy. But for regular investors in bitcoin – those not heavily involved in the cryptocurrency world – bitcoin has often got a confusing reputation. It’s known to be highly volatile with wild price swings, but at the same time some, such as Bobby Lee, co-founder and chief executive of bitcoin exchange BTCC, have called it a safe-haven asset.
“When the existing money system has problems, people turn to bitcoin sort of like people used to go to gold in the old days,” Lee told CNBC in a recent interview.
I’ve never been a big believer in bitcoin as a safe haven asset. Sure it has got a touch of support when politics has been rocky. However, a comparison on bitcoin’s performance over the past year against the Nasdaq
– a tech-heavy stock index – and the typical safe-have asset of gold
, shows that the cryptocurrency has more in common with the former.
From around mid-June of 2016, both bitcoin and the Nasdaq have been on a steady climb higher with the stock index recently breaking the 6,000 point barrier and continuing to hit fresh record highs. And it appears there isn’t a day that goes by where bitcoin doesn’t hit a fresh record high.Buying the Nasdaq represents a risk-on move and I’d argue so does buying bitcoin.
Despite a fall in the gold price after the election of President Donald Trump, bitcoin continued its rally."

8:30 a.m. International tradeWall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent.
Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day.
Nevertheless, these data — along with Friday’s jobs report — will do little to dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising rates later this month.
“They have been telegraphing their moves clearly,” said Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark. “They want to raise rates.” Thomas also noted that the central bank feels “vindicated” following the criticism directed for the way it has handled monetary policy in the past few years.
“My sense is that they see themselves in smooth waters right now, but those waters are shallow and there are rocks beneath,” he said. “Unemployment is really low, but labor force participation has barely budged.”
The Fed is set to meet June 13 and 14, with market expectations for a rate hike at 95.8 percent, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years.
“Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.
“The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It’s widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it’s a trend worth watching,” Ablin said in a note.
Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent.
“Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. “It’s still a momentum-driven market that’s skeptical about cyclical land.”
In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 6 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales.

The Nasdaq composite gained about 0.8 percent, hitting intraday and record highs. The S&P 500 also rose nearly 0.8 percent to notch all-time highs, with materials, financials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector also reached its first 52-week high since March 15.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 135 points, with UnitedHealth and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The 30-stock index also traded about 25 points away from its intraday record.
Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody’s Analytics.
The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000.
“It was a very good, positive surprise. We’ve had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current,” said JPMorgan Funds’ Kelly. “Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely.”
The report from ADP and Moody’s is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government’s nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.
“What the ADP number does is it raises expectations that the jobs report can come at the top end of the range and maybe above the estimate,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.The three major stock indexes all notched record closes.

The recent collection of positive days is flashing a sort of contrarian signal, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. While he would not bet against the index, he suggested trimming one’s holdings at these levels.
“Typically, when you have that kind of concentration of positive days, mean reversion is about to kick in. So I think it could be a situation where ‘sell in May’ could be the best prescription for the Nasdaq,” he said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
“Come out at of top and come back in September, November, when things re-rally,” Schlosberg said.
Of course, 1996 was the year then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan wondered about “irrational exuberance” and whether stocks were reaching unsustainable heights. That was before the tech bubble got blown to a staggering level, which was of course followed by a massive crash.
This period looks significantly different, according to the strategist.
“There’s no doubt that, fundamentally, all the tech companies have certainly come to the forefront. They are now the dominant companies in American industry — but that story has been really well told. I think profit-taking is due here, and I would be very cautious at trying to get long here at these levels,” Schlossberg said.
Indeed, the S&P 500 information technology sector is the index’s best-performing; tech giants Apple

On a technical basis, the index appears quite strong, said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray.

North Korea said this weekend it tested a new type of missile that can carry a nuclear warhead.

— CNBC’s Peter Schacknow contributed to this report.The Dow Jones industrial average
is on track to do something it has done only twice in the past 20 years.
The blue-chip index, which has posted record closes for four straight sessions, had gained 8.6 percent year to date entering Wednesday’s session, outperforming the and the Nasdaq composite
, which were up 6.68 percent and 5.84 percent for the year, respectively. The last two times the Dow outperformed the S&P and Nasdaq in a year when all three were higher year to date were in 2006 and 1996.
A large chunk of the Dow’s rally came after Republican Donald Trump shocked the world by winning the U.S. presidential election over Hillary Clinton. The index gained 3.79 percent between Election Day and Tuesday’s close.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said one of the main reasons for the Dow’s sharp gains following the election is that the index leans more heavily toward financial and industrial stocks than the S&P and Nasdaq do. Those two sectors have outstripped most of the market since Election Day.
“This is a Trump rally. On Election Day, institutional investors got caught on the wrong side, and you’ve seen them make major portfolio switches,” he said. “The industrials and financials have led the rally in the Dow, and that has been due to [the possibility of] higher-growth policies.”
Shares of Goldman Sachs
and JPMorgan Chase
, two Dow components, surged 17.65 percent and 14.06 percent, respectively, between Election Day and Tuesday’s close."
"The S&P 500 is outperforming the Nasdaq 100, and that’s not going to change: Traders",EDT-20161:01-PM,"The has been outpacing the Nasdaq 100
this year, and two traders believe the trend will continue.
Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Global, points out that the current global outlook and a low interest rate environment have caused investors to turn to the more defensive in their stock selection.
“I think we’re looking at this global deflationary environment for at least another quarter if not two and we’re seeing investors prefer the more defensive stocks,” she said Friday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch.” “As long as the U.S. market is the best house in a bad block and we keep looking for more of these defensive stocks, particularly with the Brexit [vote] coming up, I think we’re going to continue to see this trend of the S&P 500 outpacing.”
The S&P is up 1 percent this year through Friday’s close, while the Nasdaq 100 is down nearly 5 percent. The Nasdaq 100 is largely composed of big-cap tech stocks, while the S&P has a larger representation of names that are less levered to economic strength and to investor risk appetites. Within the S&P, the best-performing sectors are utilities and telecom services, both of which tend to be defensive, yield-sensitive plays.
“All the higher beta names you’d like to see leading in a global market are not,” Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com said Friday on “Power Lunch.” “So provided the Fed continues to remain dovish, rates on hold, those staples and utilities and dividend payers will continue to outperform.”
If he is right, investors will be better off in an S&P 500-tracking ETF like the SPY,

Later on Tuesday the New York Times first reported that Israel was the ally that collected the highly classified intelligence Trump allegedly shared.
“On balance, we’ve got a market that seems impervious to what’s going on in Washington,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. “I think the market’s keying on Washington’s ability to push tax reform.”
The rise in stocks has not been a sharp one, but rather a slow and steady grind, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. In an email to CNBC, he pointed out that the S&P had gone 14 straight sessions without a 0.5 percent close up or down as of Monday’s close.
“That hasn’t happened in nearly 22 years, showing just how rare the past few weeks have been,” Detrick said. “Although it can feel like watching paint dry, it is important to remember that some of the strongest bull markets tend to take place in dull markets. Big swings and huge daily gains and losses aren’t the hallmark of bull markets.”
The Dow Jones industrial average closed flat, with IBM contributing the most gains and UnitedHealth the most losses.
Home Depot also contributed gains on the Dow after reporting first-quarter earnings of $1.67 a share on revenue of $23.89 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters expected a profit of $1.62 per share on sales of $23.74 billion. Home Depot’s stock rose about 1.5 percent.

Health care was also among the laggards, dropping 0.4 percent after Pfizer’s stock was downgraded to sell from neutral at Citi.
Bob Phillips, managing principal at Spectrum Management Group, said the fall in health care is also reflective of uncertainty surrounding government legislation on health care.

Nasdaq CEO warns that job growth and wealth creation could be stifled if more companies don’t go public,EDT-20179:49-AM,"Citing 2011 report from the Treasury’s IPO task force, Friedman said that since 2000, 76 percent of job creation occurred after a company goes public. “If we don’t have these companies go public, it could really ultimately limit the jobs that they’re able to create and the growth they’re able to achieve,” she argued.
While Snapchat-parent went public this year, many other so-called unicorns — companies valued at $1 billion or more — remain private, including Uber, Airbnb and SpaceX.
Friedman, who highlighted the Nasdaq’s plan in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Thursday, cited three action items to help nudge companies off the fence: Modernize the market structure; reconstruct the regulatory framework; and promote long-term thinking over bending to short-term pressures from investors.
Regulations need to be streamlined to incentivize companies to go public, she said.Nasdaq
CEO Adena Friedman said Thursday more private companies should go public in order to jump-start job and wealth creation.
Friedman put out a blueprint for the plan, arguing that public markets such as the Nasdaq provide companies more opportunities to grow their businesses.
“We have the Nasdaq private market,” Friedman said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “But we also want to make sure that every investor has an opportunity to ultimately join in growth and the success of these great companies that we have that have been formed in the United States.”

Nasdaq to trial blockchain voting for shareholders,EST-201610:34-AM,"“The decentralized nature of identity manager makes it harder to falsify identity and much more difficult to duplicate a vote as there is one ledger that is the single source of truth,” Alexander Shelkovnikov, corporate venturing and blockchain lead at Deloitte, told CNBC by phone.
The blockchain used by Estonian companies would be private and only accessible to those who are using it. The companies that would take part would be on Nasdaq’s Tallin Stock Exchange, Estonia’s only regulated securities market. The pilot is aiming to launch later this year.
Blockchain has been a big buzzword among major financial institutions. A number of banks have been looking into using the technology and investing in start-ups in the space. And this is not the first time that Nasdaq has used the blockchain. Last year, the firm used the blockchain to complete and record a private securities transaction.
Shelkovnikov said that this is not just an Estonian-specific use case, but could be used for different processes, including voting in elections.
“Electronic voting, it does not just apply to stock exchange, but it could apply to what we do regularly by voting for individuals or parties,” Shelkovnikov said.In this case, a user would have a so-called private key, a unique long number given to them provided they are listed on the e-Residency records held by the Estonian government. This record will be sealed on the blockchain and cannot be tampered with. This private key would need to be used to validate yourself whenever you go to vote in a shareholders meeting online.
Essentially the blockchain would allow companies to know for sure that the person voting online is the person they say they are, due to the private key needed to take part.Nasdaq is using the technology that underpins bitcoin – the blockchain – to allow international residents of Estonia vote in shareholder meetings even when they’re abroad, in a test that could have wider implications for the adoption of the technology.
Estonia offers e-Residency which is a transnational digital identity available to people who start a business online in the nation. But if those people own stock in an Estonian publically listed firm, they need to be physically present to vote in shareholder meetings or nominate someone else to do it for them, an arduous process.
But the Nasdaq, using blockchain technology, is hoping to change that.
Blockchain works like a huge, decentralized ledger for the digital currency bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. It’s this technology that Nasdaq is now applying to shareholder votes."

How Nasdaq is catering to tech start-ups,EDT-201512:56-PM,"In 2013, Nasdaq said it was partnering with a company called SharesPost to create the Nasdaq Private Market, and on Thursday it acquired SharesPost’s minority interest in the entity. Nasdaq Private Market and SecondMarket together serve over 200 private companies including DocuSign, Pinterest and Shazam, Nasdaq said.
“Our combined offering strives to give private companies a comprehensive, company-controlled solution to attract and retain talent, while also providing tools to effectively manage their equity ownership and secondary liquidity for their employees and shareholders,” SecondMarket CEO Bill Siegel said in the press release.
Read MoreGuess who a tech downturn could hurt the most
Given the surge in the number of billion-dollar start-ups and the relative dearth of tech IPOs, there’s still plenty of demand for private transactions. Employees are sitting on mountains of otherwise illiquid equity, and often just want to raise enough cash for a car, a down payment on a house or to put a kid through college.
Albukerk said the most actively traded private company is data analytics software developer Palantir, which raised money at a $20 billion valuation in July 2014. “They’re the Facebook of today,” he said.
According to The Wall Street Journal, there are 124 venture-backed private companies valued at $1 billion or more, including 11 worth at least $10 billion. Albukerk, who started EB Exchange in 1999, said this is his busiest year ever for transactions.After Facebook’s IPO in 2012, SecondMarket’s business dwindled due to a lack of commissions. The New York-based company moved into selling software to help start-ups manage their tender offers.
“Facebook and Twitter allowed transactions, but the next generation of companies as they grew and had too many employees wanted to do it in a more organized away,” said Larry Albukerk, managing partner at EB Exchange, which facilitates the sales of pre-IPO shares. “They didn’t allow one-off transactions.”
For Nasdaq, providing technology to help emerging tech start-ups manage liquidity events is valuable because some of those companies will eventually go public. Offering services at an earlier stage gives Nasdaq a potential advantage over the rival New York Stock Exchange.When Facebook
and Twitter
were private market darlings back in 2011, their shares were being actively traded on a site called SecondMarket. So promising was this back-channel way of selling start-up shares that SecondMarket itself raised money at a $200 million valuation.
That was then. The next group of Silicon Valley high fliers like Square and Airbnb shut the market down, establishing rules that prohibited early employees and investors from selling their equity except when specifically authorized by the company.
The change helps explain SecondMarket’s sale on Thursday to Nasdaq Private Market, a unit of Nasdaq. The acquisition price was well below $100 million, said a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be named because terms weren’t disclosed. A Nasdaq
representative declined to comment on the price."

Nasdaq boss cools talk on bitcoin futures launch,EST-20174:24-AM,"Nasdaq president and CEO Adena Friedman said Friday that plans for the exchange to launch futures tied to bitcoin are only at an early stage.
In a report Thursday, Nasdaq officials told CNBC that it wanted to launch bitcoin futures as soon as the second quarter of 2018.
But Friedman downplayed that timetable during a talk at the Slush tech event in Helsinki, Finland.
“We actually haven’t announced anything. Really we are continuing to evaluate whether bitcoin can be an asset class that can exist in a more regulated market environment,” she said.
However, when pressed, Friedman said there was some work going on to discuss how to facilitate bitcoin as a tradable asset class.
“I would just say that we have been having active dialogue with a lot of clients and with partners about what might be possible over time,” the chief executive said.
Friedman added that there are two financial instruments that could be used to better regulate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
“There’s the future. That allows for hedging and other trading strategies, and there is also the ETF (exchange traded fund),” she said.
Friedman also noted that in the Nordics there were already bitcoin ETFs listed on markets.Nasdaq officials told CNBC it planned to launch bitcoin futures as early as 2018

The PCE price index — an indicator of inflation — rose 2.1 percent year over year, while core PCE increased 1.8 percent from last year.
“As the Fed loves the PCE instead of the CPI, the nearing of their 2% core inflation rate coincides with their determination of hiking at least 3 times this year. As there are 8 meetings, it’s still pretty damn gradual,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note.

“The fact that the market has held in here is a testament to how embedded that hope is in the American psyche. The question is whether that will continue,” he said.
Stocks rallied in the first quarter largely on expectations that President Donald Trump’s administration will be able to move forward with tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending policies, all of which are considered pro-growth.
However, after a tumultuous start, the administration may be forced to push back some of these policy proposals. Trump’s presidency took a hit last week when a Republican-led bill what would have replaced Obamacare was defeated.
The first-quarter rally slowed down this month, with the S&P closing flat for March, while the Dow lost 0.72 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1.48 percent.
Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said investors will need to be mindful of the high valuations in stocks moving forward. “Short-term momentum and sentiment can be very powerful but over the long-term valuations matter,” he said.
However, March also marked the eighth anniversary of the current bull market, one which is not in danger right now, according to Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors."

Some of those companies play in “terrific” sectors such as life sciences, e-commerce, and education — the last of which is particularly popular in China, the senior vice president said.
Nonetheless, the rising tide of IPO activity does not mean there’s likely to be a flood of Chinese companies into the Nasdaq, McCooey said.
“We’re only going to have a small number of companies from the [Asia-Pacific] region that will come to our market anyway. They are companies that are in certain sectors [and] have global aspirations,” he said, adding that the stock exchange will not “try to convince companies who belong in the local markets not to go to the local markets.”In a sign of Chinese businesses’ increasingly lofty and global ambitions, firms from the country are growing more active in the United States’ initial public offering market, said Bob McCooey, senior vice president of Nasdaq’s Listing Services unit.
“We’ve had double the amount of IPOs here in the U.S. than we had last year. There were only nine IPOs from China in the U.S. last year. There have been 20 so far, and on file are another 12 companies,” McCooey said.

That said, U.S. Treasurys gave up slight gains following the data’s release, with the benchmark 10-year note yield rising to 2.42 percent. Yields have pulled back from their 2017 highs since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates earlier this month, but maintained their outlook mostly unchanged.

Given how much the stocks have appreciated, his analysis suggests there will be another pullback in the sector over the next few months.
“As you hit the spring, you will probably see a rotation back into pharma stocks,” Newton said, but he doesn’t think it will be long term.
Biotechs saw a steep pullback last April and again in October, before ending the year at new record highs.
“I’m still positive on the group,” Newton said. “It’s difficult to be negative.”KCG’s Klatsky doesn’t buy the comparison to the dot-com bust, when it comes to biotechs.

A senior Trump administration official told CNBC that the White House is not ruling out slapping auto tariffs on Canada. The suggestion comes as NAFTA negotiations continue with Canada on the sidelines. It also comes as President Donald Trump is considering raising proposed tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent.
Late last week, China said it was ready to retaliate with tariffs on around $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, amid a mounting trade war. Beijing added that import taxes would be within the range of 5 percent to 25 percent in rates, with many of the goods listed linked to agriculture.
The Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates twice more this year. Last week, the U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged but upgraded its view of the economy to “strong.” The Fed’s upgraded view on the economy comes after the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy expanded by 4.1 percent in the second quarter. It also came days before the Labor Department released solid data on the labor market.

On Monday, the Nasdaq 100
index closed within 1.6 percent of its bubble record closing high from March 2000. The tech-heavy index includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial stocks traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, with more than half its holdings in large-cap tech stocks.
However, some traders are predicting a pullback for the index before it can advance to new highs.
Technician Rich Ross of Evercore ISI said the chart of the Nasdaq 100 suggests up to 5 percent pullback from Monday, when it closed up slightly to 4,630.
However, “Ultimately we take out that old high,” Ross said Monday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch.”
Looking at the ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100, QQQ
, Ross said he sees the fund reaching resistance at $114, and could retest the breakout level at $107.

QQQ rose incrementally on Monday to about $113.
“Clearly technology has been leading this market higher and there was nothing in last week’s blowout earnings to suggest that it won’t continue to lead us higher,” Ross said. “However, I think we need to go backward before we go forward.”
Erin Gibbs of S&P Investment Advisory Services said the index is not at an ideal entry point for investors, given its high valuation.

For the past two years, the Nasdaq 100 has traded in a tight range between 17.5 times to 19.5 times forward earnings, Gibbs said.
However, she said the index has exceptional growth expectations, with an average forward EPS growth rate of more than 70 percent. Because of this, Gibbs said, the index is likely to keep its winning streak in the long term.
“Longer term, I expect it to continue to go up, but when we’re trading at such peak valuations it can be very vulnerable and we can easily see a short-term pullback,” she said Monday.

Needless to say, even valuation levels that appear high by current standards are nowhere close to the peaks seen during the millennial bubble."

“I think the market is headed for jittery times,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “Those tariffs are showing up in earnings reports and eventually will hit the consumer. Once that happens, consumer sentiment will dampen.”
Tyson Foods lowered its fiscal-year earnings forecast, citing uncertainty around trade policies and tariffs. Shares of Tyson Foods dropped more than 7.5 percent.
Meanwhile, Caterpillar said in its second-quarter earnings report that recently imposed tariffs will shave off between $100 million and $200 million from its bottom line in the second half. The company also reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year outlook, however.
Wall Street looked ahead to the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy meeting, which is scheduled to start Tuesday. Market expectations for a rate hike are just 3 percent, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, but investors will look for clues on the central bank’s path toward normalizing policy.
“The Fed has said it expects to raise rates twice more this year,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “If you look at the probability markets, most people in the market expect at least one more rate hike. It is the second one investors seem to be split on.”
“Anything that provides some clarity on that would be helpful,” Keon said.
Treasury yields rose ahead of the meeting on Monday, with the 10-year yield hitting 2.99 percent, its highest level since June 13.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that at least 73 private companies around the globe are valued by venture capitalists at $1 billion or more, with 48 of them reaching 10 digits in 2014.
Venture investors including Benchmark’s Bill Gurley (an early HomeGrocer investor) and Icon Ventures’ Joe Horowitz have vocalized their concerns about the current environment, focusing not just on the surge in dollars flooding into start-up-land but the large amounts of capital that companies are burning for expansion.
If the Federal Reserve raises rates, or the economy shows signs of strain, or investors lose their appetite for risk, what happens to all those money-losing businesses that were counting on heavy doses of future financing to keep the lights on? The result will surely be painful, but the prospect of write-downs at hedge funds won’t elicit much sympathy from mainstream America.
“When it corrects, and it will, it’s not going to hurt Uncle Charlie and Aunt Agatha’s retirement account the way Pets.com and Webvan and eToys decimated those accounts when they were wiped out,” said Golden, who is now a managing partner at Revolution Ventures in San Francisco. “The fact that the public market isn’t a repository of that is a good thing.”

HomeGrocer’s Drayton has learned his lesson. Two years ago, he started Storrage, a company that’s developing technology to help storage facilities more efficiently fill their space. Billed as the “Uber of storage,” Drayton’s start-up has only raised seed funding so far and is aiming to bring in an institutional round of about $7 million in the third quarter.
Drayton is building the Seattle-based company with an emphasis on capital efficiency, utilizing existing infrastructure instead of opening up warehouses, and investing rationally in marketing.
“We don’t want to ever get in that mode where we’re so dependent on huge capital rounds,” Drayton said. “We’ll expand, but do it prudently.”
A tech entrepreneur talking about prudence? Maybe this time it really is different.Sounds crazy right? Not when you consider that Drugstore.com had generated total revenue of $4.2 million by the time of its IPO in July 1999, with a net loss in the previous six months of $30.4 million. Or what about Pets.com, home of the infamous sock puppet mascot featured in the 1999 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade? Try sales of $5.8 million and a loss of $61.8 million.
Growth at any cost was the name of the game.
“Everyone wanted you to need money constantly and do another round and another round,” said Terry Drayton, co-founder of HomeGrocer, which was opening 100,000-square-foot fulfillment centers on a monthly basis to manage local distribution. “You’re just bleeding cash.”
Webvan, which acquired HomeGrocer in June 2000 before plummeting into bankruptcy a year later, was the most troubling of all. The online grocer racked up a nine-month loss ahead of its 1999 IPO of $95.6 million on sales of $4.2 million.
Say what you will about the hefty losses recorded by companies going public today, but most of that cash burn is for building sales and marketing teams to go after the massive transition to mobile and cloud computing. And today’s public companies have a history for investors to assess.The 10 biggest U.S. venture-backed IPOs in the past year were for companies that got started between 2004 and 2008.
“These are not companies going out with a just a promise and not delivering on that promise,” said Jyoti Bansal, chief executive officer of AppDynamics, a San Francisco-based cloud software developer that’s headed for an IPO. AppDynamics said this week that bookings doubled to $150 million in the past year.

Back in 2000, HomeGrocer was actually sizable relative to its dot-bomb peers. The median annual revenue for a U.S. tech company going public in 2000 was $12.1 million (or $16.8 million adjusted for inflation) versus $90.5 million in 2014, according to data compiled by Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and finance professor at the University of Florida.
Tech companies that sold shares to the public in 2014 were valued at 6.2 times revenue compared with 31.7 in 2000, Ritter’s data show. Since 1980, tech companies have gone public with average price-to-sales ratios of 5.8, so by that measure valuations aren’t out of whack.
Read MoreWhat bubble? Legacy tech gets shut out
“Investors are much more discerning than at the time of the bubble,” said Benoit Fouilland, chief financial officer of Criteo
, a Paris-based online advertising company that went public on the Nasdaq in 2013. “What investors appreciate based on the feedback they’re giving us is the predictability of our model.”
Criteo is now worth $2.67 billion after generating almost $850 million in sales in 2014. Its technology helps brands like Lenovo
and BMW target prospective customers online. When clients are happy with the results, they boost their spending.
Still, no conversation about technology today is complete without acknowledging the froth, particularly in the private markets. Unlike in previous cycles, the tech investing market now includes a large and growing base of hedge funds, private equity shops and mutual funds acting as late-stage venture capitalists and writing checks in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The tech-laden Nasdaq index has hit the 5,000 benchmark for the first time in 15 years. Sure—big, round stock market numbers are purely symbolic, but this one carries with it quite a bit more baggage. To call it a generation’s worth wouldn’t be unfair.
Last time it ended badly—very badly. The four scariest words in stocks are, of course, “it’s different this time,” but should investors be wary now?
March of 2000 is the only other month in history the Nasdaq
ever laid eyes on 5,000, peaking at 5,135.52. Just five months earlier, the index was valued at half that amount, and by the end of the roller-coaster year it would again be down by half.
But back then, it was more than just smoke and mirrors. It was madness. It was Pets.com and Webvan and $5 trillion of paper wealth just waiting to evaporate. When it rapidly vanished, scores of Silicon Valley office parks were left vacant almost overnight, glutting the market with pool tables, Aeron chairs and kegs of pale ale.
Read MoreIPO boom to continue?
David Golden, who ran investment banking at Hambrecht & Quist during the bubble years, recalls one particular idiom that encapsulated the mayhem, “If you could fog a mirror, you could go public.”
The end result, when the dust finally settled in October 2002, was Nasdaq 1,108.49.
Fast forward to the present and, to use the most dangerous cliché in finance, things are different this time. The new Nasdaq 5,000 is built on the value of every Google
search, Facebook status update, Amazon.com
purchase, iPhone app and super high-speed device powered by an Intel
or Qualcomm processor.
These aren’t PowerPoint presentations filled with pie-in-the-sky forecasts. These are some of the biggest franchises in the world, and they’ve driven the Nasdaq to its current level.

Are we in another bubble? It’s certainly possible. But it’s important to see why Nasdaq 5,000 much makes more sense today than it did 15 years ago.
For starters, it’s taken more than three years for the index to double this time around versus a few months in the dot-com days. And when was the last time you saw a business like online supermarket HomeGrocer sell shares to the public?
HomeGrocer was readying its IPO when the Nasdaq first topped 5,000, on March 7, 2000. It debuted on March 10, the day the index peaked. The Kirkland, Washington-based company had $21.6 million in annual revenue and a net loss almost four times that large. The valuation: $1.5 billion."

The Nasdaq hit a new intraday record and posted a new closing high, as health care stocks rose. The S&P 500 closed unchanged for the first time in nine years, with consumer discretionary leading advancers and real estate lagging. The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 30 points, after briefly flirting with the psychologically important 20,000 mark.
“We’ve had a little bit of back-and-forth recently ... which coincided with improving economic data,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, who noted the market was trying to get back some of Monday’s losses. Equities ended Monday’s session mixed, with the Dow and S&P closing lower, while the Nasdaq rose.
The NFIB’s small business survey results for December showed sentiment soaring to a 12-year high. Wholesale inventories, meanwhile, rose 1 percent, slightly above estimates. The job openings and labor turnover survey (JOLTS) for November showed job openings remained little changed at 5.5 million. That said, the number of people quitting their jobs hit a record high, which shows confidence in the economy.
“Clearly, the breadth [in the market] has declined,” said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. “There are some near-term concerns. The near-term concern I have is the rising dollar.”

Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said the “response to the earnings announcements from three of America’s biggest money center banks seemingly hints at an uneven upcoming reporting season,” He also added, however, that ”if companies can maintain their extremely elevated profit forecasts for the next several quarters, then stocks should enjoy a stiff tailwind at their backs.“
Just over 5 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter results thus far. These companies have posted earnings growth of 16.37 percent. However, analysts polled by FactSet expect second-quarter earnings to have grown by 20 percent.
Stocks posted strong weekly gains, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all rising more than 1.5 percent. The major indexes have risen as concerns over a trade war between the U.S. and China have eased.
Earlier this week, the U.S. unveiled tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. However, a lack of response from China to these levies has assuaged some fears of conflict escalation.

Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman: Trump’s 2017 will be a ‘show me’ story,EST-20179:01-AM,"Friedman, who was formerly Nasdaq’s president and chief operating officer, took over as CEO on Jan. 1. She said her company’s focus for the new year will be on technology.
“For us, it’s a matter of making sure that we continue to take all of the new technologies that are available in the marketplace and bringing them into our markets and offering them out to our clients,” she said.
Blockchain, a database that tracks all bitcoin transactions, is one such technology, Friedman said.
Despite the hurdle of federal regulation, a concern that is fading for many companies in the face of a more pro-business administration, Friedman said that the protection, speed and efficiency blockchain provides will turn skeptics around.
“At this point, you’ve got to end up showing either a reduction of risk or a benefit to the clients in terms of the ability for them to get things done faster with more certainty,” Friedman said. “If you can really prove that out, then I think that the regulators will get on board with it.”The Twitter-happy president-elect has changed the policy game, but he now faces the challenge of implementing his plans, Nasdaq

So will the Nasdaq soon gain another 8 percent to hit its record—or will the S&P 500 or the Dow rise 8 percent first? In other words, what’s the best index to hop onto right now?
According to Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global, the Nasdaq is set to break its record before the others rise 8 percent.
“I’d wager on the momentum,” Sanchez said. “The fastest-running horse in that group is the Nasdaq. It has been leading the stock market generally higher.”
Sanchez, a CNBC contributor, expects the tech sector to push the rest of the index higher. The Nasdaq composite is more tech heavy than the other indexes.
The technicals are also indicating a higher Nasdaq, according to the chart work of Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com. He is positive on the index because he sees some of its biggest sectors improving.
“We’re starting to see technology pick up,” said Gordon, a CNBC contributor. “I like the sector makeup to the topside.”
But Gordon believes that the way the Nasdaq composite will grow will be based on how another index does—the smaller, large-cap Nasdaq 100.
“That is your tech-driven Nasdaq, not the composite, which encompasses other sectors,” he explained. Gordon said the Nasdaq 100 is targeting its August 2000 high.
“We actually have further to go if this is a tech-led rally,” Gordon added.

Sanchez said that while high-flying momentum stocks have been sold off, they may still be overvalued. “There are parts of the Nasdaq that could continue to trend lower,” said Sanchez, a CNBC contributor. “We have priced in so much growth into this market and if we don’t see it, we’re going to have to correct.”
Richard Ross, global technical strategist at Auerbach Grayson, is also negative on the Nasdaq.
In early March, it traded above 4,371 only to pull back 9.7 percent in a little over a month. “It just stops right there to a dime on [its] 200-day moving average,” said Ross, a “Talking Numbers” contributor. Since then, the index has bounced back to around its February highs, closing Monday at 4,368.68.
That’s closing in on where Ross sees resistance—at 4,440. He sees the Nasdaq beginning a reverse-head-and-shoulders bottom starting in 2007 and ending three years later. The neckline resistance of that pattern was at 2,800 while the bottom was in the 1,200 range.
“That provides us with a very nice upside measuring tool,” Ross said. “The height of that pattern is 1,600 points.”
Projecting above the neckline—1,600 points above 2,800—puts the target at 4,400.
“With our upside target almost realized,” said Ross, “I don’t need to be a buyer of the Nasdaq here at the tail end of a five-year virtually straight-line move, considering how far above trend we are. So, if this pattern is to work at all—which it has very well in the past—this is not where you want to be buying the Nasdaq. It’s where you want to be taking profits and being a seller of the Nasdaq.”

"Techs surge on earnings, boosts Nasdaq, S&P 500 to record close",EDT-20154:30-PM,"In Europe, European equities were higher on earnings despite little progress on Greece debt talks in the meeting of the euro zone finance ministers.
Greece is willing to make compromises to reach a deal on its debt, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said on Friday after tense talks with his euro zone peers on this issue.
“The cost of not having a solution would be huge for all of us, Greece and the euro zone,” Varoufakis told reporters.
Greece is running out of cash and needs a last tranche of bailout aid in order to meet debt repayments. So far, its reform drive has been slow and the aid has not been released.
Earlier, neither ministers involved nor analysts were holding out hope for a deal on Friday.
German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said he did not believe there would be decisive progress on Greece in Riga, while his Austrian counterpart said he was “quite annoyed” with the lack of progress over reforms, Reuters reported.

If this key trend ends, stocks could be in trouble
Cloud set to take over retail in 10 years: Amazon CTOThe Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Nasdaq
closed up 36 points, or 0.71 percent, at 5,092.08, a new record.
Advancers were a touch ahead of decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 765 million and a composite volume of 3.3 billion in the close.
High-frequency trading accounted for 47.5 percent of March to date’s daily trading volume of about 6.2 billion shares, according to TABB Group. During the peak levels of high-frequency trading in 2009, about 61 percent of 9.8 billion of average daily shares traded were executed by high-frequency traders.
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 12.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield
held near 1.91 percent. The U.S. dollar weakened, with the euro creeping towards $1.09.“The tough part is if we get a new high, how much higher do we go after that?” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
Futures briefly pared gains following durable goods that beat on the headline figure but showed a disappointing decline in the core figure.
Durable goods, ex-transportation, fell 0.2 percent, below expectations for a slight gain but less than February’s 1.3 percent decline. Including transportation, which tends to be volatile, the report posted an increase of 4 percent for March, surpassing expectations for a moderate bounce back, after February’s disappointing 1.4 percent month-on-month drop.
With no other economic data expected, major stocks moving the market higher included Microsoft
, Google
, Amazon.com
, and Starbucks
, which reported earnings after the bell on Thursday.
Starbucks surged more than 4.5 percent to hit an all-time high on Friday. The coffee retailer topped expectations for global same-store sales and beat on both the top and bottom lines.
Despite major gains in those major names, nearly half, or 212, of the S&P 500 was trading below their 50-day moving average. SanDisk
, PulteGroup
and Xerox
were the worst performers.
“We see that narrowing of that breadth of the market and that’s not healthy. We need a broad advance,” said Lance Roberts, general partner at STA Wealth Management.
He said if the S&P 500 closed above 2,111.19, “we’ve broken out of consolidation and the bullish trend is intact.”
To Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, the market is “not bifircated.”
“Earnings is a time when we pick winners and losers,” she said, noting how companies declined or gained based on their business model.
She was most excited about gains in IBM and Amazon from their cloud computing services.
“Everybody thinks it’s the new companies in the Silicon Valley that will be responsible for (the cloud),” she said. But for the bulk of operations “you turn to a company that’s in your trusted data center.”

Cable stocks were in focus as Comcast
announced on Friday that it ended pursuit of a deal to acquire Time Warner Cable

Investors also kept an eye on oil, which closed at a new high for 2015 on Thursday but failed to hold that level on Friday.
“I think it’s getting a little ahead of itself,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. “We’re probably headed to $60 but in the short-term overpriced.”
Crude oil futures settled down 59 cents, or 1.02 percent at $57.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures ended down $19.30 to $1,175.00.U.S. stocks closed higher on Friday, with the Nasdaq setting another record as investors cheered major earnings reports. (Tweet This)
“It looks to me like the bloodless verdict of the market is earnings are acceptable,” said Maris Ogg, president of Tower Bridge Advisors.
The Nasdaq Composite closed at a record for the second day in a row. The index set its first record close in 15 years on Thursday, topping the previous high from March 2000.
The S&P 500 ended mildly higher for a new record close. Earlier, the index also touched a new intraday high, while the Dow struggled to shake off a decline as its top-weighted stocks lagged.

Microsoft
surged more than 10 percent to lead blue chips gains. The company posted earnings and revenue that beat estimates after the close Thursday, as the firm shook off the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar with growth in hardware sales and commercial cloud computing.
Amazon.com
closed up 14 percent after spiking 15.5 percent to a new intraday high. The stock gained despite reporting an expected decline in earnings and light guidance. Revenue did beat expectations with a boost from the e-commerce firm’s primary market, North America.

“It shows me there’s still a lot of speculation in the market,” Bittles said, noting the inability of the Dow and S&P to reach the same record levels as quickly as the Nasdaq.
The Dow Jones industrial average still had more than 1 percent to go before surpassing its record close.
Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a note that “we expect a breakout to be confirmed in the days ahead, allowing the SPX to resolve its triangle pattern to the upside. Typically, triangles give way to sharp moves, and a measured move price projection would get the SPX to about 2180. Notably, the (Nasdaq Composite) is approaching final resistance at its 2000 high—a breakout would clear an important psychological hurdle from the chart.”"
Nasdaq posts record close as Facebook and Netflix rise to all-time highs,EDT-20184:17-PM,"“Anytime you get news like that, the market takes it as a positive,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. “We’re also ready for a rebound, ... but I think the market will stay volatile until we focus again on earnings.”
Cardillo said lingering trade tensions between the U.S. and some of its key partners, especially China, will keep investors on their toes for the time being.
The Dow Jones industrial average
, meanwhile, fell 42.41 points to 24,657.80 and posted its seventh straight day of losses, its longest losing streak since March 2017. The 30-stock index briefly rose more than 100 points earlier in the session.
Stocks fell on Tuesday as trade tensions between the U.S. and China intensified. The Dow led the way lower, sliding nearly 300 points and erasing its gains for 2018.
Late Monday, President Donald Trump requested the United States Trade Representative to identify $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for additional tariffs, at a rate of 10 percent. Following Trump’s statement, Beijing reacted by pledging to retaliate against the U.S., with its Commerce Ministry stating that the U.S. had initiated a “trade war that violates market laws and is not in accordance with current global development trends.”
“The administration doesn’t view trade as “just politics,” it views balancing trade as existential for the U.S.,” said Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel, in a note. These concerns will remain on the table for the market regardless of how the midterm elections in November unfold, he said. “Trade laws are tailor-made for a negotiator president without Congress, making trade a growing (not peaking) risk.”
Trade tensions among the largest economies in the world have increased recently as the Trump administration aims at obtaining more favorable trade deals and conditions for the U.S.
“If you look at the impact of this, it’s rather small right now,” said Mark Esposito, CEO of Esposito Securities. He noted that the stimulus coming from the tax cuts passed last year outweigh the negatives stemming from trade concerns. “Cooler heads will prevail. The fact of the matter is the market wants to go up.”
But investors got a reprieve Wednesday from the negative news on trade. The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. ambassador to Germany had met with the leaders of German car makers BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler, where they pitched the idea of ending car tariffs between the U.S. and the EU.
During these talks, the executives said they would be in favor of scrapping these levies as part of a broader deal encompassing industrial goods, the Journal said.
Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance rose more than 5 percent after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced it would replace General Electric on the blue-chips index. General Electric, meanwhile, closed 0.5 percent lower.
Starbucks shares dropped by 9.1 percent after announcing it plans to close more than 150 stores in the next year and after lowering its sales guidance for the third quarter. The stock also posted its worst day since July 2017 and is on track for its worst week since 2016.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 closed higher on Wednesday, boosted by dealmaking activity and potentially improving trade relations between the U.S. and the European Union.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq
rose 0.7 percent to 7,781.51 to close at an all-time high, led by Facebook and Netflix, which also reached record levels. Facebook and Netflix rose 2.3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. The gained 0.2 percent to end at 2,767.32, with real estate stocks outperforming.

"Nasdaq CEO: Could’ve done better on SecureWorks, but at least IPOs are pricing",EDT-201612:25-PM,"—Reuters contributed to this story.“You have to understand that … in the first quarter, we had a lot of IPOs that tried to get out, that did not get out because the window was completely shut,” Greifeld told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”
Ten IPOs priced on the Nasdaq exchange in the first quarter, which Greifeld called subpar. The exchange has about 120 IPOs on file waiting to debut, he said.
In Greifeld’s view, companies with strong economic performance and those with “pure innovation,” such as biotech start-ups, have a good chance of going public in the current market.
Greifeld spoke after the Nasdaq Group beat quarterly earnings profit forecasts, though revenues came in just shy of expectations.
The stock exchange operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of 91 cents per share on revenues of $534 million. A consensus estimate had seen profits coming in at 89 cents on revenues of $535 million.
“We’re doing well. We’ve picked the proper businesses to diversify in, and in the businesses we are competing in, we’re gaining share,” Greifeld said. “Certainly it shows the diversification of our model. We had a great quarter without any real IPOs.”Nasdaq
CEO Bob Greifeld acknowledged on Wednesday that the initial public offering for information security firm SecureWorks
could have gone better, but he pointed to a silver lining: at least IPOs are finally pricing.
In the first IPO of a U.S. technology company in 2016, SecureWorks raised $120 million, less than it had hoped for, amid investor skepticism over its profit margins and prospects. The stock slid in the session after last week’s IPO."
Nasdaq CEO: What I want to see from the Trump administration,EST-20164:46-AM,"Bob Greifeld, CEO of the Nasdaq
, said the plan could be carried out easily, and it would be something he would like the Trump administration to do.
“What’s in the order of doable and could have been done under the Obama administration is a deal on repatriation. That deal is there to be done. I think it’s relatively low hanging fruit,” Greifeld said during a panel at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, moderated by CNBC.
“There are hundreds of billions of dollars offshore that companies would like to bring onshore and I think the effective clearing rate is probably around 10, 12 percent and then you become relatively indifferent. So for me, that affects all industries there, whether it’s used to fund an infrastructure bank which I think is good policy. I’d like to see that happen.”Repatriating the “hundreds of billions of dollars” of cash kept offshore by companies should be one of the top priorities for Donald Trump’s administration, the chief executive of the Nasdaq said Wednesday.
U.S. companies excluding those in the financial sector had over $1.2 trillion stashed overseas at the end of 2015, according to ratings agency Moody’s. Many technology companies have large cash piles overseas. For example, Apple has over $200 billion abroad.
Trump has proposed cutting the tax rate for companies bringing back cash to the U.S. to 10 percent from around 35 percent currently. The idea is that this will encourage corporations to repatriate cash that can then be used for domestic investment."

U.S. stocks posted a sharp rally this week on the back of Republican Donald Trump’s surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, as investors considered the prospects of higher infrastructure spending and less regulation within the financial sector.
That said, Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said in a Friday note that uncertainty around Trump’s presidency remains.
“One of investing’s bedrock principles is that markets dislike uncertainty, and the Trump victory leaves investors with several unanswered policy questions. The election results are unlikely to have a material impact on total economic growth, but markets will be in more of a ‘reactionary’ mode than usual due to the need for policy clarity and priorities from the new administration,” he said."

Nasdaq rides biggest trading rollercoaster in five years,EDT-20144:51-PM,"—By CNBC’s Patti Domm“This stuff just got tremendously overloved and with anything that’s overloved, it turns into obsession,” said John Stoltzfus, Oppenheimer Asset Management chief strategist. “Then it turns into a reversal and everyone just gets out of it.”
But the reversal may be a head fake and not capitulation. “I think we’re still in the process of realizing correct valuation on a group of securities,” said Steve Massocca, portfolio manager of the Wedbush Hedged Dividend Fund. “I think there’s going to be bounces, and this is one of them.”
While both the Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 were down more than 9 percent from their March highs Tuesday, the S&P 500 was down just 4 percent and the Dow down just 3 percent. The Nasdaq’s about face was the biggest turnaround since April 1, 2009 when the Nasdaq moved 3.5 percent.
The last time the Nasdaq fell more than 10 percent was from September, 2012 to mid-November, 2012 when it lost 10.9 percent. Earlier that year it lost 12 percent between late March and June 1. Since then, the current decline is the worst for the relatively volatile index, and a 10 percent decline will get attention.
Ten percent from the closing high is 3,922, and 10 percent from its intraday high is 3,934. The Nasdaq hit an intraday high of 4,371 on March 6, but it was still at that point below its March, 2000 record high of 5,132.

“It’s not a magic number, but it’s a number that people will talk about more. It would be official correction territory,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. “It’s all semantics but (10 percent) that’s the level you generally consider for a correction. I think it would add more weight to the selloff.”
Besides the 10 percent level, the Nasdaq came within four points of its 200-day moving average of 3,942.
“In addition, that 10 percent falls right within 10 points of the 200-day moving average, and we haven’t gone through that level in a year,” Hickey said. “Technically speaking, a big break of the 200-day moving average is considered a negative.” But Hickey said that it is not a consistent metric.
The IBB, watched by traders as a barometer for momentum, broke its 200-day moving average this week and has been trading below it.
Analysts say the Nasdaq correction does not necessarily mean the other indexes will fall as hard. “I don’t think just because the Nasdaq is down that much means the others have to fall that much. The Nasdaq tend to be a more volatile index. It’s going to have more volatility swings. They don’t have the support of the utilities which has been holding up the S&P,” Hickey said.
Stoltzfus expects the market to correct mainly around the momentum names. “At the beginning of the year, there was a lot of love for tech. The hedgies got into it, the fast money crowd, and now they’re leaving it. A lot of people were looking for a selloff,” he said. “The momentum stocks got hit justly for overvaluation. We just see this as really an interlude. It’s like a movement in music. It’s a downward motion but we don’t think it’s real meaningful for the course of the year of 2014. If anything, it’s probably healthy.”
While many Nasdaq names were getting crushed Tuesday, utilities were more than 1 percent higher.
“Dividend yield on the S&P utilities right now is 3.66 percent, which looks a lot better than the 10-year Treasury at 2.61 percent,” Stoltzfus said.
He said he does see some value in the older tech names, like Microsoft
, and he rated it “market weight.” “If you look at the broad (Nasdaq) index, 5 percent (decline) year-to-date, four months into the year, doesn’t make us blink much,” Stoltzfus said. “We happen not to be chasing momentum stuff. We did with biotech but the Gileads
and the Amgens
are what we love, and we like the longer-term story on this stuff. We don’t think this is the end. This is a detour, but it’s not the end of the road.”Whipped by volatile internet and biotech stocks, the Nasdaq staged a more than 2 percent rally back from the brink of correction territory Tuesday in the biggest one day turnaround in five years.
At its lowest point Tuesday, the Nasdaq was off 9.7 percent from its March intraday high of 4371 - close to the 10 percent threshold that some traders say marks an official correction. But the market bounced back, and Nasdaq ended the day with an 11 point gain at 4034, about 7.7 percent below its March 6 high.
Some of the very stocks that helped push the to fresh 14-year highs by early March were slammed in early trading Tuesday, adding to losses of more than 20 or 30 percent from their highs. The poster child for momentum—the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB
—was down as much as 24 percent from its Feb. 25 high Tuesday but closed in positive territory.
Social media and internet names were also down sharply, with Facebook
and Amazon.com
both off more than 20 percent from the March high. But Facebook, Amazon.com and others closed higher on the day.

Nasdaq recovers tech-bubble high,EDT-20155:25-PM,"“Nothing has changed in my opinion. I think this is a two-way tape. Some stocks are working. Some aren’t. Some sectors are working. Some aren’t,” said Paul LaRosa, chief market technician at Maxim Group.
LaRosa said the Fed is going to raise rates and the market will have to adjust to it, and Greece hangs in the balance as a possible mine field for markets if it defaults.
“While we may break out, and the other two indices could fall in line, I don’t see right now the predictability for a major upward move. We still feel we’ll be in a choppy, sideways and volatile market for now. I don’t think these big swings are done with. It wouldn’t shock me if we’re down 200 points tomorrow,” he said.
LaRosa said higher rates could hurt earnings and could also stall out the surge in corporate debt issuance that has helped boost share buybacks.
“So if they stop buying back stock, what happens? the market goes down. ... All of these pitfalls are on people’s minds which is why you’re seeing this two-way tape. It has to be resolved one way or other. We had the Fed meeting, and rates are going to tick higher. People have to plan for that reality,” LaRosa said.On Wednesday Fed Chair Janet Yellen reassured markets that the Fed is not yet ready to raise rates and that it does not see the economic fortitude to do so. But Fed officials, in their statement and forecasts, signaled they expect a better economy and that they could hike rates one or two times this year.
Greece also was a factor, as traders were generally optimistic it would reach a deal with its creditors.
“I’m very concerned we’re going to have some sort of a corrective move here. Basically, what drives those is everybody who has access to a price chart, which is everybody, could see this as a good place to take profits off the table,” said Kosar.
But Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said with the Fed still unclear on when it will boost rates, the market’s bias is to go higher. He said unanswered are questions on timing of the first rate hike and how many increases there could be this year.
“I don’t think the (Fed) statement or the press conference resolved any of the issues that investors are wrestling with,” he said.
Stocks have been stuck in a sideways push and pull, as traders worry about the potential impact of Fed rate hikes, a Greek default, and possibly sluggish earnings.

The S&P 500 on Thursday was up nearly 1 percent, but was still a good 15 points below its all time high of 2,134. The Nasdaq in the past year has gained 17 percent, more than double the 8 percent gain of the S&P. The Dow was about 225 points below its high of 18,351 Thursday, but the Russell 2000, like the Nasdaq has broken into new territory.The Nasdaq regained its tech-bubble high Thursday on the wings of a Fed-induced rally, but the market is likely to remain volatile even if other indexes also reach new heights.
“This a 15-year-old high. When you test levels like that rarely have I seen one sustainably and appreciably broken,” said John Kosar, chief strategist at Asbury Research. “Markets have a memory, and when you get to old levels, people like to buy off of old lows. People like to sell off old highs.”
The Nasdaq, rallying with the broader market, gained more than 1.2 percent, and pushed to a new high several points above 5132.52, the intraday high it reached in the peak of the tech bubble in March 2000."
Online learning company Pluralsight spikes in debut on Nasdaq,EDT-20184:07-PM,"The company’s losses and revenue widened in the first quarter, with a $23.16 million loss on $49.64 million in revenue, compared with a $9.81 million loss on $37.24 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Around two-thirds of the company’s revenue comes from within the U.S.
Pluralsight was founded in 2004 — Skonnard is one of its four founders — and is based in Farmington, Utah. The company had 890 employees on March 31. Investors include Insight Venture Partners, Iconiq Capital and former U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.
Pluralsight is part of a collection of tech companies that have gone public in the past few months. Others include DocuSign, Dropbox, Smartsheet and Zuora.

—CNBC’s Sara Salinas contributed to this report.Shares of online learning company Pluralsight
began trading on the Nasdaq at an opening price of $20 per share Thursday, roughly 34 percent above the $15 price at which Pluralsight priced shares in its initial public offering. The stock closed at the same price at which it opened.
The arrival of Pluralsight on public markets suggests that public investors are still eager to invest in smaller technology companies.
Pluralsight first filed to go public on April 16. On May 7, the company said it estimated it would price shares between $10 and $12 each. And on May 15 Pluralsight upped the range to $12-14 per share. Finally, on May 16, the company announced the $15 pricing, coming in above the high end of the most recent range.
At that price, Pluralsight raised $310.5 million at an implied valuation of around $1.97 billion. Morgan Stanley
and J.P. Morgan
acted as the lead book-running managers in the deal.
While anyone can pay to take Pluralsight’s courses online, the company focuses on education for many employees inside companies. In its filing to go public Pluralsight said competitors include Alphabet
’s YouTube, Cornerstone OnDemand
and Microsoft
’s LinkedIn Learning.
Pluralsight offers more than 6,700 courses. At the end of the first quarter the company had 14,830 business customers, and at the end of last year it had more than 695,000 end users. In the first quarter 82 percent of Pluralsight’s billings came from business customers.
“Technology is moving faster today than these companies can learn it so that creates a big skills gap around the world,” CEO Aaron Skonnard told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” ahead of the opening trade. “We make it possible for them to learn these skills quickly, keep up with that pace of change and thrive in the digital age.”
The company maintains an “army of expert authors” around the world to keep courses up to date and relevant, Skonnard said.
“That’s what makes our value proposition unique,” he said. “No one else can move as quickly as us to provide that skilled training into the enterprise.”Pluralsight ended its first day of trading at the same place where it started.
The company raised $310 million in its initial public offering, pricing shares above the high end of its range."

Yields across the globe have been spiking higher lately amid hawkish rhetoric from key central bank officials, including European Central Bank President Mario Draghi.
The 10-year German bund yield rose to about 0.46 percent from around 0.25 percent this week. U.S. Treasury yields followed their German counterparts higher, with the benchmark 10-year yield climbing to 2.28 percent from 2.15 percent.
Higher yields have helped bank stocks this week, with the SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund (KBE) advancing 3.8 percent in the period.
“Banks have a lot going for them,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. “Not only could the economy be getting better and rates are rising, but regulations seem to be going down.”
The banks also received a boost after the Federal Reserve cleared capital returns programs for the big banks.
The central bank did not object to any of the buybacks or dividend hikes from the 34 banks it reviewed during the second phase of its annual stress test. This is the first time in the seven-year history of the tests implemented in the wake of the financial crisis that all banks have passed.

Financial tech firm iZettle says it plans to list on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange this year,EDT-20188:31-AM,"Swedish payment start-up iZettle announced it will go public this year.
The financial technology firm said Tuesday that it plans to raise 2 billion Swedish krona ($226 million) through an initial public offering on the Nasdaq in Stockholm.
The company provides mobile card readers and other digital payment products to small businesses. It is a rival to Square
, the U.S. fintech firm led by Twitter
CEO Jack Dorsey, but only competes directly with the $20 billion company in the U.K.
IZettle said in a statement that, “depending on market conditions,” the Stockholm listing is expected to be completed this year.
The company’s CEO Jacob de Geer has previously spoken of the company’s intention to go public, saying that it was surrounded by “ifs and buts, market conditions and so-forth.” Tuesday’s announcement solidifies that intention.
“We believe that the listing will support our continued growth, our strategy and provide us with improved access to capital markets,” De Geer told CNBC.
“Our strategy going forward is to grow our merchant base in existing markets as well as shift the mix towards slightly larger merchants, though we’ll continue to remain focused on small businesses.”
IZettle is currently a loss-making company, but it’s targeting net revenue growth of 40 percent in the medium term and wants to achieve positive consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) by 2020.
“We made a strategic choice together with the board to prioritize growth over profitability, to build iZettle’s brand and secure a leading position in our target markets,” De Geer said.

Crude futures for August delivery climbed 0.49 percent to settle at $42.74 a barrel. On Wednesday, oil hit its lowest level since August as investors remained concerned about a supply glut in the market. The commodity also fell more than 2 percent during Tuesday’s session.
“We’re seeing a number of indications of a softening economy,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “We’re growing but it seems like we’re slipping back into the slow-growth trend that’s been in place for most of the recovery.”
The pullback in oil prices pressured energy stocks. The S&P energy sector had dropped 3.5 percent for the week entering Thursday’s session.
Still, the broader market has stood its ground, with the S&P and Dow up marginally for the week, while the Nasdaq was had risen 1.34 percent in the same period.
“Oil is becoming less important since it only makes up about 6 percent of the S&P 500”, said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. “In the overall context of things, we know that oil is the new coal and gas is the new oil. Crude just isn’t a commodity in short supply.”
Despite energy’s recent pullback, the overall indexes remain near record highs. Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital, said he expects stocks to keep climbing higher. “Corporations are doing well and we have a backdrop of low corporate rates,” he said.

Health care stocks have been on a tear this week as investors braced for the unveiling of the Senate’s health care bill, with aims at repealing and replacing Obamacare.
The bill would continue to offer reimbursements to health insurance companies for subsidies for at least two years. It would also do away with current Obamacare taxes and would phase out Medicaid’s expansion program. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill next week.
“At this point, it looks like [the vote] will have the same intrigue as the house vote,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank. He also said health care stocks may be benefiting from a sector rotation from technology into other spaces.Health care outperformed Thursday, with the XLV ETF hitting a record high.

Hong Kong scrambles for talent in battle for Nasdaq’s biotech crown,EDT-20189:19-PM,"Hong Kong’s appeal to would-be IPOs rests largely on its familiarity with Chinese firms, its convenient timezone for mainland executives and its new rules.
“On Nasdaq, the main investors for biotech stocks are mainly U.S. funds, but, in Hong Kong, we can better tap Chinese and Asian investors as we are closer to them,” said Yang Dajun, chairman of Ascentage Pharma, a Chinese biotech company.
JPMorgan
analysts forecast that China’s biologics industry will double in size to $52 billion by 2021 compared with a global growth rate of 60 percent. Biologics are the products
produced by biotech and biopharma firms.
While U.S. companies have been the largest capital-raisers, accounting for 44 percent of industry funds raised through IPOs in the past five years, Chinese groups were next, accounting for a fifth, according to Thomson Reuters data.
All that has sparked interest in Hong Kong. Last June, shares in the drug developer Wuxi Biologics rose 39 percent on their debut and now stand 167 percent higher.
However, industry insiders and market participants warn of risks in the sector, saying that many biotechs are reliant on a handful of early-stage new drugs, making them vulnerable if one fails.
Mary Leung, the CFA Institute’s Asia Pacific head of advocacy, questioned the ability of average investors to evaluate such companies.
“Given how long it will take for pre-revenue companies to demonstrate whether they are successful, for retail investors, it’s almost like investing in bitcoin,” she said.
This is a particular issue for Hong Kong, where retail investors often expect to be protected by regulators. Until now, the city’s rules have been strict, requiring three years of profitability, or a certain level of cashflow, before any company can apply to list.
About 20 percent of daily trading in Hong Kong is undertaken by small-time investors, compared with about 2 percent in New York.
“Will we have the courage to stay with it because 30 to 40 percent of these biotech companies will fail and they may crash spectacularly?” Ken Hitchner, Asia-Pacific chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs
, said at a conference last month.
“We will have spectacular successes — we will have future Tencents
across tech, across biotech. But there will be front-page headlines of really spectacular implosions and that’s the nature of dealing with the bleeding edge of innovation.”When Hong Kong unveiled plans last year to encourage biotech companies to list in the city by loosening listing rules, the financial industry and investors cheered.
Hong Kong was an obvious financing center for a growing number of Chinese companies developing new drugs. But as the new rules come into effect Monday, at least one problem has become evident: Hong Kong’s limited expertise in the biotech field.
Biotech companies without revenues, let alone profits, will now be allowed to apply for listings in the city under the new rules. Some 10 companies — mostly Chinese, including the Temasek
backed Innovent Biologics and Shanghai Henlius Biotech — are already planning floats and some have dropped U.S. IPO plans in favor of listing closer to home.
The result however is a scramble for experts in a city whose financiers have limited experience with science.
Just 3 percent of all Hong Kong-listed stocks, by capitalization, come from so-called “new economy” sectors — tech as well as biotech — according to a report last year by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the bourse operator.
That compared with 60 percent for Nasdaq and 47 percent for the New York Stock Exchange.
Several bankers, investors and industry executives estimated that the city currently had fewer than 20 experienced biotech and biopharma bankers.
“It’s not easy to hire the right professionals,” said Kevin Xie, head of healthcare and co-founder of China Renaissance, a boutique investment bank. “There’s a limited pool globally who truly understand the industry.”
Leading investment banks are touting their ability to transfer bankers from the United States to plug gaps in Hong Kong. But lacking local licences, those seconded to Hong Kong can only advise their colleagues, not work on deals themselves. Li Hang, head of Greater China equity capital markets at CLSA, said: “We really need sector specialist bankers to run biotech deals, otherwise everybody will say we don’t know how to do the due diligence.”
Difficulties around talent go beyond the banks. Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX, said last month that it was tough to hire biotech professionals. “All financial institutions in town have been seeking such talent,” he said.
Nonetheless, Li said Tuesday, when announcing the finalized rules, that HKEX had found a dozen experts, primarily scientists or employees of pharmaceutical companies, to serve on a board advising a listing committee that approves each IPO application.Hong Kong unveiled plans last year to encourage biotech companies to list in the city by loosening listing rules to much fanfare from the financial industry and investors.

Market participants are not expecting any alterations to interest rates. However, investors will be on the lookout for clues about the central bank’s views on inflation and the economy.
“The bad news is that inflationary pressures are building. The good news is that Fed officials must be doing a victory dance,” said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, in a note. “That’s because they’ve been trying to boost the inflation rate closer to their 2.0% target ever since they publicly announced it at the start of 2012.”
“Now that their mission seems to have been accomplished, Fed officials are likely to stay on their announced course of gradually tightening monetary policy,” Yardeni said.

"Waiting for NASDAQ 5,000? Don’t hold your breath, say strategists",EST-20134:18-PM,"If investors in the S&P 500 index are having a great year, people who bought the NASDAQ Composite Index are having a fantastic year. While the market benchmark S&P 500 is up 28%, the NASDAQ is up 37.5%. Only six times in the last quarter century have returns been so high.
Only recently, the NASDAQ traded once again above 4,000. That’s territory not seen since 2000, when the NASDAQ was coming off its highs.
Back at the end of 1999, the NASDAQ breached the 4,000 mark for the first time. By March 2000, it crossed the 5,000 only to begin its fall back to 1,114 by October 2002.
(Read: The future of medicine means part human, part computer)
If the NASDAQ were to have another good year, it could get to 5,000 once more. It wouldn’t have to be as good of a year as 2013, either. The 5,000 level is a little more than 20% higher than where it is today. How likely is that?
Let’s look at the data. Since 1987, the NASDAQ has given investors about a 10% annualized return. That means if you had put your money in the NASDAQ on January 1, 1987 and did nothing for the next 26 years, you would have an account that looks like you’ve been earning 10% per year on your money.
Except that’s not quite how it panned out. Returns on the NASDAQ were very volatile during the last quarter century. The standard deviation of returns was 30%. So, basically, for a little more than two-thirds of the time, your returns were in a range between -5% -20% and 25% 40%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index gave slightly higher returns (around 11%) with less volatility; two-thirds of the S&P 500′s returns during that period fell between 2% -7% and 20% 28%.
Meanwhile, in the six times the NASDAQ was up more than 30% since 1987, the average return the following year was 18%. That includes the 86% up year in 1999 and the -39% drop in 2000. Take out those two outliers and the average is more like 16%.
(Watch: U.S. economy primed for more growth in 2014: Pros)
The likelihood of the NASDAQ to have another up year and hit 5,000 is low, says CNBC contributor Andrew Busch, editor and publisher of The Busch Update.
“Twenty-five percent is a big number to make after 35%,” says Busch. “So, [it’s] not likely.”
Instead, Busch is has a more modest upside target for the index.
“The level I have for the NASDAQ is the 4,292 level,” says Busch. “That’s where we bumped up and hit there back in July 2000. And, I expect that to be the target that we might get to next year.”
The NASDAQ behaves less like the S&P 500 and more like Japan’s benchmark Nikkei index, says Busch.
“I look at the NASDAQ – because it was so crazy back in the late ’90s and early 2000 – somewhat more like the Nikkei than rather the Dow. As everyone knows, the Nikkei’s top was 37,000 and we’re still almost 50% below that. So, the fact that we’re at 4,000 is a good sign.”
(Read: 2013 prediction recap: Nailed Nikkei, failed HP)
Like Busch, CNBC contributor Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, also thinks the NASDAQ won’t likely hit 5,000 in 2014.
“I think 25% is going to be a pretty tough place for it to get to,” says Sanchez.
Sanchez sees the index’s highflyers like Facebook and Amazon as having propelled the NASDAQ above 4,000 but having difficulty maintaining their high relative valuations in the future.
“But, there are even other great, forgotten parts of the NASDAQ that could continue to go up like the biotechs,” says Sanchez. “I think the biotechs are really ignored.”
Just don’t count of biotech companies to bring the NASDAQ above 5,000, warns Sanchez.
“The pieces of the NASDAQ that are forgotten aren’t really large enough to drive the NASDAQ another 25%,” says Sanchez. “But that’s not to say there aren’t parts of the tech index that are worth buying.”

—Reuters contributed to this report.The U.S. equity market will be closed on Monday due to Memorial Day, which led to subdued trading volumes. As of 4:07 p.m. ET, just 5.2 billion shares had been traded, well below the 50-day average of 6.7 billion.
Equities came into Friday’s session riding a six-day winning streak, with the S&P and Nasdaq indexes notching record highs on Thursday.
“Although the S&P 500 closed on a record peak last night, its forward multiple has compressed by half a point in the past twelve weeks. Stocks are hardly cheap; however many large portfolio managers continue to funnel capital into sectors, such as technology, that offer growth potential and liquidity,” said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities.
Technology has been the best-performing sector this year, rising nearly 20 percent in the period. Leading the charge for the sector have been large-cap stocks such as Facebook, Netflix and Amazon, which have risen more than 30 percent in 2017. Amazon’s stock was also within striking distance of reaching $1,000 per share.
U.S. Treasury yields traded mixed, with the benchmark 10-year yield slipping to 2.24 percent and the two-year yield around 1.297 percent.Stocks closed mixed on Friday ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend and digested key economic data.
“I think the market is just taking a breather to figure things out,” said Aaron Jett, vice president of global equity research at Bel Air Investment Advisors. But “I don’t think the market is going to make a significant move lower because the fundamentals don’t support it.”
The Dow Jones industrial average closed just below the flatline to snap a six-day winning streak, with Home Depot contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite closed marginally higher, notching fresh record closing highs and extended their winning streak to seven sessions.
The major stock indexes posted strong weekly gains, rising more than 1 percent in the period.
“A lot of what we’ve seen this week is investors being pretty comfortable with their positions and that’s why we’re seeing so little selling ahead of the long weekend,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones.
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the first quarter, an improvement from the first reading on economic growth.
The sluggish first-quarter growth pace is, however, probably not a true reflection of the economy’s health. GDP for the first three months of the year tends to underperform because of difficulties with the calculation of data that the government has acknowledged and is working to resolve.
The second read on first-quarter GDP “provides us with a higher starting point to Q2 but those estimates for Q2 are now moving lower. Yesterday, trade and inventories led to a drop in estimates and today’s durable goods report will drag it down even further. So we have a higher than expected Q1 but now a lower than forecasted Q2,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said the comments in the Beige Book were not surprising. “The economic data certainly doesn’t call for a rate hike but the fed funds rate should never have been this low in the 7th year of an economic expansion,” he said in a note to clients.

U.S. Treasurys traded mixed , with the two-year note yield near 0.73 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.54 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.124 and the yen near 101.7.
In corporate news, Apple
is scheduled to hold an event later on Wednesday, where the company unveiled its latest iPhone. Apple’s stock rose 0.63 percent.
“One would have to think that’s playing into the Nasdaq,” said Adrian Day, CEO at Adrian Day Asset Management, ” But ... I can’t imagine this will be anything revolutionary.”U.S. stocks closed mixed Wednesday, with consumer staples lagging, as investors digested the release of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 12 points lower, with Home Depot contributing the most losses.
“It does feel like a calm before a storm as we head into the next Fed meeting,” said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, pointing to recently weak economic data. “People are starting to talk about that, whether it’s noise or is it a sign of something scary coming ahead.”
The S&P 500 closed less than a point lower after briefly trading higher, with consumer staples falling around 1 percent.
“The logical person at this juncture can look at the data and say the Fed is not going to raise interest rates,” said Adam Sarhan, CEO at Sarhan Capital. “What the market is asking the Fed is where is this hawkish data that supports a rate hike.”
The Nasdaq composite set a new all-time intraday high of 5,287.61 and a record close of 5,283.93. The index also posted a four-day winning streak.
“I think the reason the Nasdaq is hitting all-time highs is because of this sector rotation we’ve seen recently,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities."
"We may not be in a bubble, but here’s why the Nasdaq isn’t cheap",EDT-201510:06-AM,"Tech mergers and acquisitions are heating up and they are reaching levels not seen since the days of the 2000-01 tech bubble. As the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index hits its highest levels since 2000, could this be a sign of another peak for tech?
Since the start of the year, over $174 billion in announced tech deals have been announced, according to Thomson Reuters. But Chantico Global’s Gina Sanchez said the high M&A volume alone doesn’t signal a new bubble, although there are worries.
“You are definitely seeing it in segments of the market where you see valuations that just are pricing in irrational exuberance,” said Sanchez, a CNBC contributor. “That tends to be a sign that there’s too much money.”
Sanchez cites biotechs, Amazon, and Tesla as examples where valuations have gotten frothy. “We see plenty of examples where we see some pretty hefty valuations in the tech space—well over 50 times, 100 times forward earnings,” she said. The fundamentals here to me look stretched.”
Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, is not as down on the Nasdaq’s health, but he nonetheless sees a correction ahead based on the index’s charts.
“This is a new Nasdaq compared to 2000,” said Gordon, a CNBC contributor. Whereas the majority of the index’s composition was in tech back in 2000, today it is down to the low 40 percent range. Stocks like Cisco were leading the charge 14 years ago—some with valuations at triple-digits times forward earnings. But today’s Nasdaq is led by Apple, a stock trading at a relatively modest 15 times forward earnings.
Gordon believes technicals on the Nasdaq are just healthy—and may even help it break above its all-time highs, but it won’t be a smooth ride.
“Technically, it looks solid,” he said. “I think we’re in a longer-term uptrend. I do think we eclipse those 2000 highs.”
To be sure, the Nasdaq is hitting the upper bounds of an uptrend Gordon sees as beginning in 2011. “We do need to reset a little bit and test the lower end of that channel, all within that longer-term uptrend,” he said. “Unfortunately that equates to about a 20 percent decline.”
Gordon backs up his analysis by charting the Nasdsaq’s Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the trend’s strength.
In 2011, when the ADX was between 35 and 40, a 20 percent decline followed shortly after. “Now we’ve just seen another strong ADX reading up around 40 and we’ve yet to see that pullback,” Gordon said. “That pullback should equal that May 2011 correction of about 20 percent all within the context of the longer-term uptrend.”

"After a stellar 2013, expect a NASDAQ pullback",EST-201411:09-PM,"Upside targets: Between 2010 and 2011 the NASDAQ moved in a narrow sideways trading band with the lower edge near 2360 and the upper edge near 2920. The first NASDAQ breakout target near 3520 – calculated by projecting the width of the sideways trading band upwards – has been achieved. Applying the sideways trading band projection again, a second target is set near 4100 and a third near 4620.
There is a high probability the market will consolidate near the 4100 resistance level. This is a solid uptrend that has accelerated very quickly since March, 2013, thus a breakout above resistance near 4100 and the value of trend line B is not sustainable. Investors should wait for a pullback to inside the trading channel.
(Read more: Venture capitalists’ best ideas for 2014)
Line A: Long-term uptrend line A defines the extent of any large fall in the NASDAQ that is still consistent with a continuation of the uptrend. A fall below the long-term uptrend line would signal a change to a new downtrend.
Thus, the NASDAQ could fall to near 3300 and still remain in a long-term uptrend trading channel. From the current high near 4200 this would represent a 21 percent fall – a major market correction similar to the 19% fall from 2920 to 2360 in July, 2011 when the lower edge of trading channel trend line A and the 2360 level acted as support.
The NASDAQ’s behavior around the 4100 resistance level is critical. There is a high probability of a retreat to inside the trading channel followed by a rebound. The steadily rising NASDAQ trend is defined with the up-sloping trading channel. It continues in a bullish environment with 4620 as the next upside target.

However, with the Federal Reserve set to reduce its asset purchases this month investors can’t help but question the likelihood of a repeat performance in 2014. Down 1.5 percent in the first few days of the New Year, charts suggest that the NASDAQ may face a pullback, but ultimately the environment remains bullish.

Charts show that the NASDAQ index has a steady and strong uptrend with an up-sloping trading channel. Best seen on a monthly chart, there are three features: the trading channel, potential upside targets and the position of long-term uptrend line A.
The trading channel: Trend lines A and B are the lower and upper edges of the trading channel, respectively. The NASDAQ has moved above the upper edge of the trading channel, thus there is an increased probability of a retreat."

“We expect the focus to shift to French legislative elections in June. These will be crucial for determining Macron’s ability to implement his economic program, which includes labor market reforms that would make it easier for French businesses to hire and fire,” strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note Sunday.
“We are positive on European shares and see potential for renewed investor inflows as
focus returns to the region’s improving growth,” they said.
U.S. equities traded slightly lower for most of the session, but the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 10 and briefly dipped below 10.
Energy and consumer discretionary were among the best-performing sectors in the S&P. “Right now, some people are looking for value. It’s some of the stuff that’s lagged recently,” said Craig Sterling, head of U.S. equity research at Pioneer Investments.
In U.S. economic news, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester spoke before the open.
Mester — a known hawk in the Fed’s policymaking committee — said in a speech: “We have met the maximum employment part of our mandate and inflation is nearing our 2 percent goal.”
The Fed held off on raising rates at its meeting last week, but set the table for a June move. Market expectations for a rate hike next month were 83.1 percent on Monday, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
Bullard, however, struck a more dovish note in his Monday remarks. He said that continued strong demand for safe assets along with sluggish growth in the U.S. workforce will hold down
U.S. interest rates for the foreseeable future.
In corporate news, Sinclair Broadcast will acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, or $43.50 per share. The announcement sent Tribune’s stock more than 6 percent higher and Sinclair’s 2.8 percent higher.
Coach also agreed to buy Kate Spade for $2.4 billion, or $18.50 per share, in an effort to resonate more with younger consumers.
In total, there were more than $13 billion in announced U.S. mergers and acquisition deals Monday, said Richard Peterson, senior director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, he also said announced deal value for this year is down about 2 percent from 2016.
Wall Street also parsed through key economic data out of China, as the country’s exports and imports failed to meet expectations for April.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, said global investors will be more concerned about China’s economy “if there is further evidence of a slowdown.”
“You can’t have the second-largest economy in the world [slowing down] without having the global economy feeling a pinch,” Cardillo said.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 notched new all-time intraday and closing highs on Monday despite a narrow trading range as investors digested Emmanuel Macron’s victory over Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election.
The indexes broke above their respective record intraday highs shortly after the open and eked out a record close. The Dow Jones industrial average also closed marginally higher, with Apple contributing the most gains.
“It’s a case that everyone had priced in, but people were still scared about another Brexit,” said Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.
Macron cruised to win the French presidency, securing at least 65 percent of the vote in the election’s second round. Investors across the globe largely expected this outcome as most polls projected the 39-year-old to win.
“We had the big move after the first round two weeks ago,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. “The market never discounts the same thing twice and that’s why we’re treading water.”
Equities around the world rallied following the first round of the French election on April 23.
This is the second bullet global markets have dodged from European elections. Earlier this year, the Netherlands far-right party — led by Geert Wilders — came in second place in Dutch elections, a disappointment considering the party led most polls leading up to the election.
Also, a Le Pen victory would have raised questions about France’s future in the European Union and the euro zone."
Why the Nasdaq defies the odds,EST-201311:49-PM,"The second feature is the NASDAQ’s potential upside targets. These are calculated by taking the width of the trading band and projecting it upwards. The first upside target after the breakout above 3150 is calculated through this method.
Between 2010 and 2011 the NASDAQ moved in a narrow trading band with the lower edge near 2300 and the upper edge near 2900. The first target for the NASDAQ breakout is calculated by projecting the width of the trading band upwards and gives a target near 3500. This has been achieved.
This trading band projection method can be applied again to set a second target near 4100. Applying the same trading band projection method, a sustained breakout above 4100 has a third target near 4620. However there is a high probability the market will consolidate near 4100.
(Read more: Forget Apple, Google…this is Nasdaq 2.0)
The third feature is the position of the long-term uptrend line. This line defines the extent of any fall in the NASDAQ that is consistent with a continuation of the uptrend. The current value is near 3300.
The NASDAQ could fall to near 3300 and still remain in a long-term uptrend. From the current high near 3914 this would represent a 15% fall. While this would be a major market correction, a fall to near 3300 remains consistent with the long-term uptrend and would represent a buying opportunity for the brave hearted.
A fall below the long-term uptrend line would signal a change to a new downtrend with an initial downside target near 2900 and a longer-term downside target near 2300.

The index’s behavior around the next resistance level is critical. There is a high probability of a retreat followed by a rebound. This is simple trend trading.

Nasdaq poised to fall from record high after Apple iPhone sales disappoint,EDT-20178:20-AM,"U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq composite set to fall from a record high after mixed quarterly results from Apple.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted record highs on an intraday and closing basis on Tuesday before Apple released its quarterly results.
Investors also awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision on interest rates.
It’s the second day of the Fed’s policy meeting. A decision from the central bank is due in the afternoon around 2 p.m. ET, but markets expect the Fed to hold steady. It has forecast two more interest rates hikes for this year, and the market thinks odds are greater than 50 percent that the next hike will come in June.
On the data front, the U.S. private sector created 177,000 jobs last month, according to a report from ADP and Moody’s Analytics. Economists polled by Reuters expected an addition of 175,000 jobs.
The ADP and Moody’s Analytics report is seen as a preview to the government’s monthly jobs report, which will be released Friday.
We’ll also get the final Markit services PMI reading for April, as well as the ISM non-manufacturing reading.
On the earnings front, AIG, Facebook, Kraft-Heinz and Tesla are due to report after the bell.

index was around 0.2 percent lower on Wednesday morning. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite in China closed 0.25 percent lower, while the Nikkei in Japan closed 0.7 percent higher.

The Fed, however, is not expected to shift monetary policy when their meeting concludes. Market expectations for a rate hike following this meeting are just 4.8 percent, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
That said, investors will be looking for more clues about the Fed’s plan to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
“The FOMC has always encountered turbulence when trying to ‘land the plane.’ Reducing an inventory of $4.5T of fixed income securities to something far more stable presents the biggest challenge of the most protracted and complex tightening cycle facing the central bank since its founding in 1913,” said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note to clients.
The U.S. central bank raised rates at its March meeting, pushing the overnight funds rate to a target range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent.
Investors also looked ahead to a slew of economic data due later this week, including the April jobs report, which is due Friday.
“We have some more data later this week, so I’d expect [relative] volatility to pick up in the coming days,” said Matt Weller, senior market analyst at Faraday Research.
Equities closed mixed on Monday after a brief shock stemming from President Donald Trump’s comments on breaking up the big banks. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trump said he was “looking at that right now.”
Stocks declined sharply after Trump’s remarks but managed to rebound.
Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
, widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, hit its lowest level since February 2007 on Monday, falling as low as 9.90.
“That seems pretty alarming, but if you look beyond the headlines, the Vix sustained those levels for most of 2004 and 2005,” said Faraday’s Weller. “So it may not be indicative that a top is near.”
In economic news, automakers released their U.S. April sales numbers throughout the day. Total sales hit 16.88 million for April, below an expected annual rate of 17.2 million.
In Europe, equities closed higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising 0.75 percent amid solid economic data. Investors in the region also looked ahead to a runoff in the French presidential election between centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
“If Le Pen were to somehow win, I think you’d see a downside move without the bounce,” said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global. “It would be a risk-off event.”U.S. equities closed mostly flat on Tuesday investors awaited earnings from tech giant Apple.
The Nasdaq composite hit an intraday record of 6,102.72 and eked out a closing record, with shares of Apple also hitting a new high. Apple’s stock also had the most positive impact on the Nasdaq 100 index, which also reached a record high.
Apple is set to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the bell Tuesday. One of the key metrics investors will be watching out for in those earnings is iPhone sales.
The tech giant makes most of its money from iPhones — and even if it meets estimates of 52 million, that’s not a lot more than the 51 million it reported a year ago.
Apple’s earnings have topped analyst expectations 15 of the past 16 quarters, while sales have missed just four times in the same time period, according to UBS research from April 24.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 35 points, with 3M and Visa contributing the most gains. The S&P 500 chopped around the flatline for most of the session, with information technology, industrials and health care outperforming.
“The big three events this week are the Fed Meeting, the labor figures due Friday and some of the big earnings” set for release this week, including Apple, said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. “So it’s not surprising to see such an uninspiring session.”The Nasdaq composite hit an intraday record of 6,102.72, with shares of Apple also hitting a new high ahead of earnings.

LPL Financial Research said in a Tuesday report the S&P recorded its fourth-tightest trading range of the year on Monday. “What made yesterday even more unique though is the S&P 500 also made an intra-day new all-time high (although it didn’t close at a new high).

“The lack of productivity directly relates to the slow economic recovery seen since the recession. Combine this with a good pace of hiring and higher labor costs as a percent of revenue will only continue to increase,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group.

Right now, it’s something to look at, but it won’t spark a sell-off” yet, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial.U.S. stocks ended slightly higher Tuesday, with the Nasdaq posting a fresh record close, as investors kept an eye on falling oil prices.

There are “really just very few alternatives for investors around the world,” said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. “Investors are looking for return and yield, and the U.S is the best option for that.”
Sentiment is “more risk on than risk off,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. “The play here is that we’re going to have a decent second half.”
The Dow Jones industrial average closed nearly 4 point higher, well off session highs, with Walt Disney contributing the most gains.

Tesla shares also fell 8.2 percent after the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board announced it would investigate a fatal crash that took place last week.
Twitter fell 12 percent after short-seller Andrew Left said he is betting against the stock. “Everything’s changed; everyone is talking about data privacy,” Left told CNBC. “They’re a lot more vulnerable than Facebook.”

“We’re still in an environment that’s a bit hesitant, but yesterday was incredibly important,” said Michael Hans, CIO at Clarfeld Financial Advisors.
Equities rallied sharply on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. and Chinese officials were working to ease trade tensions between the two countries. The major averages rose more than 2.5 percent, notching their best one-day gains since August 2015.
“We’re seeing confidence being restored in the market and that’s because of fading trade worries,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Some investors “could come back in the market or renew long positions.”
International markets also received a boost Tuesday after Wall Street’s strong day, with both Asian and European indexes posting gains during their respective sessions.
“The market did what it needed to when it needed to on Monday, as the major indices logged historically strong bounces across the board,” said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet. “This helped prevent large bearish patterns from breaking.”
Stocks had been under pressure prior to Monday’s rally as investors fretted over the economic implications of a trade war between the U.S. and China.
Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum that would inflict tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese imports prompting China to retaliate. The Dow briefly dipped into correction territory following the news, while the S&P 500 reached its 200-day moving average, a key technical level.
But J.P. Morgan U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said in a note Tuesday investors should buy after the recent dip.
“The market appears to be overreacting to sequential negative narratives …, we believe strong macro and fundamentals will continue to prevail,” Lakos-Bujas wrote. “Most of the selling seen over this period has been largely technical …, and as such represents a buying opportunity for fundamental investors.”
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Monday that its clients bought the dip seen last week. “Big net buys of US single stocks plus small inflows into ETFs led to total net buys of $3.0bn,” the note said.U.S. stocks closed sharply lower on Tuesday, erasing earlier gains, as a decline in the broader tech sector brought the major averages down.

Facebook shares contributed to tech’s losses, as they fell 4.9 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its price target on the stock for the second time in five days. The cut comes as Facebook’s fallout from the data scandal continues.
Last week, reports emerged alleging that Cambridge Analytica, an analytics company, had gathered data from 50 million Facebook profiles without users’ permission. While Facebook has since come out to apologize and try to rectify the matter, concerns remain over data use.
CNN reported Tuesday that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify in front of Congress on the Cambridge Analytica leak.
“While this will not be a pleasant experience for Zuckerberg and his team going in front of Congress, it is a necessary smart strategic step for Facebook to head to the Beltway as the public fury continues to grow around the Cambridge data leak,” Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights.Facebook shares contributed to tech’s losses, as they fell 4.9 percent after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its price target on the stock for the second time in five days.

The major U.S. stock indexes closed marginally lower Wednesday, holding within 1 percent of their intraday highs, after the announcement of President Donald Trump’s tax plan. Top officials called the proposal the “biggest tax cut” in U.S. history but remained vague on highly anticipated details such as the tax rate on repatriation of overseas profits.
“I just think we’re a little extended after the two-day move [earlier this week],” said Peter Coleman, head trader at Convergex. “Everybody’s anticipating the tax plan. Although they gave some detail it wasn’t very specific.”
Durable goods orders rose a less-than-expected 0.7 percent in March. Weekly jobless claims increased more than expected to 257,000. Pending home sales fell 0.8 percent in March.

Comcast, PayPal and Amazon.com were among the greatest contributors to gains in the Nasdaq.
Ahead of the open, NBCUniversal parent Comcast
reported better-than-expected quarterly profit of 53 cents per share and revenue also above forecasts. Shares climbed nearly 4 percent, tracking for their best day since Feb. 3, 2016
Information technology was among the top S&P 500 performers, while energy was the worst, dropping more than 1 percent as oil prices fell about 2 percent on oversupply concerns.
U.S. crude oil futures for June delivery hit their lowest since March 29 and settled at $48.97 a barrel, tumbling 1.3 percent.
While the summer driving season has historically helped drive oil prices higher, domestic inventory levels “remain elevated by historical standards,” Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, said in a Thursday note to clients.
“We remain hard pressed to get excited for the prospect of higher oil prices in a sub-two percent GDP growth environment as production in the U.S. continues to increase and rig counts rise,” Bell said. “Incremental demand from emerging markets would be necessary to more substantially drive down inventory levels.”
Alphabet, Amazon.com
, Intel
, Microsoft
, and Starbucks
are among companies set to report after the closing bell.
“It’s policy grabbing the headlines but the earnings still drive the market and the matter of the fact is, the earnings have been pretty good,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade."
"Nasdaq 5,000 a ‘blip,’ going higher: CEO",EST-20157:09-PM,"Diane Garnick, CEO of Clear Alternatives, agrees the changed composition of the index is great for investors.
“The companies in the Nasdaq today have business plans that they are executing on. We have companies with earnings. Not only that we have companies with a lot of cash on hand,” she said.

In fact, earnings are up 150 percent since the last time the Nasdaq hit 5,000, Garnick noted.
The economy is also different this time around, CNBC senior contributor Larry Kudlow pointed out.
Back then, the Federal Reserve was “tightening like crazy” and the steep inverted yield curve had recession written all over it, he said.
“I’m not saying there’s no corrections, there are going to be corrections. I just think it is a totally different economic picture and I think this one’s sustainable,” he said.
“There is no inverted yield curve and recession and/or recession in sight for several more years. … That’s why I’m not so panicked.”

David Garrity, principal at GVA Research, would continue to own the Nasdaq and noted that when adjusted for inflation, it would have to hit 6,900 to match Nasdaq 5,000 from 2000.
“We’re not even close,” he said.The Nasdaq composite index
closed Monday above 5,000 for the first time since March 2000 and the pros were in agreement: Times have changed.
For Craig Kanarick, CEO of Mouth and co-founder of Razorfish, Nasdaq 5,000 is a “blip.” He thinks the index will go much higher, in part because the companies in the index are stronger.

saw their 5th positive session in a row, with the composite hitting its highest level since July 2015. The Nasdaq 100 touched its highest level in 16 years.The IBB saw its highest level in 6 months while posting its 4th straight positive session.
Trader Tim Seymour said that investors will find the most value in the technology sector “because I think you have the best valuations, the most capacity.” He said, however, that does not mean all companies are equal in this space.
“Within technology, the semis aren’t really what does it for me. I think you’re probably chasing growth. For me, first of all, Google
gives you the best combination of both. If I had to allocate to big cap tech, it would be Google, it would be Apple

Trader Pete Najarian agreed and said even some of the big cap chip stocks have room for growth. He pointed to Intel

The Nasdaq cited the criminal indictment and arrest of the company’s former CEO Martin Shkreli; the arrest and indictment of Evan Greebel, KaloBios’ former outside counsel, and a civil complaint by the U.S. SEC against Shkreli and Greebel in its notification.
The drugmaker said on Monday that it had fired the controversial Shkreli on Dec. 17, the day he was arrested on charges of a securities fraud."
As the Nasdaq falls a buying opportunity arises,EDT-201411:37-PM,"Using the same method, a sustained breakout above 4100 has a third target near 4620. This is the long-term target for a rebound after the current retreat.
The position of the long-term uptrend line A: This defines the extent of any large fall in the Nasdaq that remains consistent with a continuation of the uptrend. For instance, the Nasdaq could fall to near 3500 and still remain in a long-term uptrend trading channel. From the current high near 4370 this would be a 20 percent decline – a major market correction. It’s similar to the 19 percent fall from 2920 to 2360 in July 2011 when the lower edge of trading channel trend-line A and the 2360 level acted as support. A future decline to the lower edge of the trading channel near 3500 on trend-line A remains consistent with the long-term uptrend.

This is a temporary trend retreat and correction, not a trend change, thus investors will use the retreat as a buying opportunity. The U.S. tax year ends on April 30 so some of this sell-off is tax driven.
There is a high probability the retreat to inside the trading channel will be followed by a rebound. The Nasdaq trend is defined by the up-sloping trading channel with 4620 as the next upside target.

Following its stellar 38.3 percent rise in 2013 the Nasdaq has lost momentum as the Federal Reserve further tapers its asset-purchase program. Down 3.4 percent year to date, the index suffered its biggest single-day drop in two-and-a-half years last Thursday underscoring the pullback.
This raises one key question for investors: is this is a temporary retreat, or a significant change in the trend? A retreat would present a buying opportunity for a continuation of the uptrend, while a change in the direction of the trend would be a sell signal to protect profits.

The Nasdaq has a steady and strong up-sloping trading channel which is best seen on a monthly chart. The chart has three analysis features: a trading channel; potential upside targets; the position of long-term uptrend line A.
The trading channel: The lower edge of the trading channel is defined by trend-line A, while the upper edge is defined trend-line B. The Nasdaq’s move above the upper edge of the trading channel and resistance near 4100 increased the probability of a Nasdaq retreat.
Potential upside targets: The Nasdaq’s first upside target near 3520 is calculated by projecting the width of the sideways trading band upwards; this has been achieved. Applying this projection method again we find a second target near 4100, which has also been achieved."
5 stocks that could lead the Nasdaq to a record,EDT-201711:35-AM,"With the Nasdaq composite
about 3 percent away from following the and the Dow Jones industrial average
to record levels, CNBC PRO asks which stocks will lead the way if the tech-heavy benchmark posts a new high before the month is out.
With Kensho, an analytics tool used by hedge funds, CNBC Pro searched for the Nasdaq members that rise the most when the benchmark is in rally mode. Specifically, we looked at all the times the Nasdaq composite rallied 3 percent in seven days or less (there are seven trading days left to July).
Here’s what we found:"
Cramer explains how short-sellers drove the Nasdaq to its record high,EDT-20178:02-PM,"Take Tesla
, whose stock has been soaring of late. The automaker was a short-seller favorite in the past because of its desperate need for financing to reach its goal of producing 500,000 cars per year.
But in light of Chinese internet giant TenCent’s $1.7 billion purchase for 5 percent of Tesla, the company is now sitting pretty.
“Case closed on the short side. No wonder the stock’s been a rocket. The bears no longer have anything to hang their hat on and they’re responsible for a great deal of this turbo-charged move,” Cramer said.
Or look at Amazon
, the e-commerce powerhouse that is spending all over the place and fueling its burgeoning stock price through innovation and efficiency.
“We basically want the company to grow revenues more than show profits and that’s exactly what it’s doing. This record-breaking move has been made on the backs of the short-sellers who thought, wrongly, once again, that Amazon’s growth had finally begun to peter out,” Cramer said.
Even Netflix
hit an all-time high on Thursday after being knocked by the short-sellers for lagging growth, despite the company insisting that the bottom line hit came from a credit card error.
“The shorts have been hung badly” on Netflix, which is once again seeing a healthy acceleration in growth, Cramer said.
So while Cramer does not think shorting is a bad strategy, having practiced it for years at his old hedge fund, he does believe it can occasionally result in serious damage to companies, or in a surge of buying like we have seen in March.
“Some will call it a blow-off in these names. Me? I just say the shorts got the wrong side of the trade,” he said.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comAfter the Nasdaq posted a record close on Thursday, Jim Cramer realized that sometimes, it’s all about unraveling the shorts.
“The net impact here is that when the shorts are wrong, they create a wave effect of fierce buying that’s like a a huge burst of acetylene on an already-lit fire. That’s a big part of what’s been happening here with some of these huge market capitalization Nasdaq stocks that just seem to levitate almost daily,” the “Mad Money” host said.

Nasdaq 100 rally can be credited to just two stocks,EST-201511:38-AM,"Further exclude third- and fourth-largest contributors Facebook
and Netflix
, and we’re looking at an index that’s actually down 5 percent in 2015.
Of course, some stocks always perform better than others. But the narrow leadership of the Nasdaq 100 has become a major topic of conversation on Wall Street.
“The money continues to crowd into the same names. The gap between the FANG stocks and the SPX remains wide,” Michael Block, chief strategiest of Rhino Trading Partners, wrote in a Thursday note, referring to an acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google and to the S&P 500 index.
“This will eventually end in tears,” Block warned.
Larry McDonald, head of U.S. strategy at Societe Generale, believes that such “crowding” is reflective of general fears about the market on the part of asset managers.
“What you’re really seeing is fear,” he told CNBC. “Let’s say that you have to be invested in stocks, or perhaps in growth stocks specifically. Well, if you’re nervous about the market, you’re going to pick the biggest, most liquid names possible — your Facebooks, your Googles, your Amazons.”
For that reason, McDonald sees the stunning outperformance of a few choice names as an ironic reflection of bearish sentiment that will eventually take the overall market lower.While the and the Dow
have had a mild 2015, rising 1.1 percent and falling 0.5 percent, respectively, another widely followed large-cap index is having a great year: The Nasdaq 100
.
The technology-heavy set of stocks has risen by 10 percent this year.
But that doesn’t mean every tech investor has done well. In fact, the outperformance can be squarely pegged on just two names: Amazon
and Alphabet
(formerly known as Google).
Those two companies (which technically comprise three stock tickers, given that two different flavors of Alphabet shares are in the index) have added 478 points to the Nasdaq 100 in 2015, according to FactSet. The index itself has only risen by 419 points this year.
That means that incredibly, if not for Amazon and Alphabet, the outperforming Nasdaq 100 would actually be down on the year.

Cramer isn’t quite so bearish. He believes that the divergence between the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 has everything to do with a rotation out of Internet growth stocks, which largely trade on the Nasdaq, and into dividend yielders, which largely trade on the S&P.
“I don’t believe in sell in May and go away,” the “Mad Money” host said. “But Carley Garner is a terrific technician and her chart work warrants serious consideration. Frankly, given the speedy run to record highs, there’s nothing wrong with a little caution here.”

Questions for Cramer? madmoney@cnbc.com
Questions, comments, suggestions for the “Mad Money” website? madcap@cnbc.comLooking at the moving average convergence divergence line, or MACD, an important momentum indicator that analysts often use to predict where a security is headed, Garner says that even when the Nasdaq has stabilized the MACD continued to decline. That’s a bearish sign.
Also, she says the Nasdaq is nearing strong levels of resistance on the upside. She notes the first level of resistance is 3,742 while the second level of resistance is 3,813. Largely, trendlines suggest to Garner that the ceilings will not be pierced by a short-term rally. In turn, Garner believes the subsequent selling could be brutal.
Turning attention to the S&P 500, she says the index has been trading in the same upward channel for a year now, and at the moment, the high-end of the channel forms a ceiling of resistance at 1,930. Garner believes the chances of the S&P breaking out above that 1,930 level are pretty slim.
In addition, Garner has analyzed the seasonal performance of the S&P 500 over the last 10 years, and found that from May through October the S&P’s performance has been weaker as compared to January through April. Therefore, she believes investors may follow the adage and “sell in May and go away.”Although Garner sees reason to believe the Nasdaq can rally modestly in the short-term, she says that over the long-term, the technicals suggest the path of least resistance is lower.
Looking at historic trends in the chart above, Garner finds that more often than not, when the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 have diverged, the Nasdaq has served as the leading indicator, not vice versa.
In turn, that would suggest current weakness in the Nasdaq should be viewed as a precursor to forthcoming weakness in the S&P.
However, that’s not the only pattern that Garner finds bearish.(Click for video linked to a searchable transcript of this Mad Money segment)
Across Wall Street, investors have grown worried by the frequent divergence between the S&P 500
and the .
That is, there have been many sessions in which one index has climbed, while the other has declined. Broadly, they move in tandem.
Is the divergence a new normal or a sign of trouble?
For insights, Jim Cramer turned to technical analysis from Carley Garner, the co-founder of DeCarley Trading.
Looking at trendlines, Garner says the divergence rarely lasts any significant length of time. Ultimately, the indexes reconcile and again trade in tandem.
Of course, that begs the question, will they reconcile higher or lower?"
Why you shouldn’t count out the NASDAQ just yet,EDT-201412:02-PM,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average may be at record highs, but the NASDAQ Composite index is down 2.5 percent on the year. And since its March peak, the tech-heavy index is off 5 percent.
The selling may continue, but that’s perfectly alright, according to portfolio manager Chad Morganlander of Stifel Nicolaus’ Washington Crossing Advisors.
“I think it’s just a healthy pullback,” Morganlander said. “You can expect 3 to 5 percent pullback on the NASDAQ.”
(Read: Dow rises to record close; Nasdaq ends worst week in a month)
Morganlander sees investors continuing to move money out of highflying momentum stocks that were all the rage in 2013 and into value stocks such as Oracle and Cisco. “I would look towards some of the old tech names as value plays for good opportunities in 2014,” Morganlander said. “I think you can get paid well for taking on the risks there. But a 3 to 5 percent correction [in the NASDAQ], that wouldn’t shock me.”
Mark Newton, chief technical analyst at Greywolf Execution Partners, believes that news of the NASDAQ’s demise has been greatly exaggerated.
“We would really need to see a lot more sign of deterioration to think that the NASDAQ is going to fall a lot further,” Newton said.
Newton dismisses what other technical analysts see as a head and shoulders pattern in the NASDAQ. That formation is said to begin in December with a neckline around its April 16 lows near 3,946. The index also touched its 200-day moving average at that low point.
“We really haven’t confirmed those patterns,” Newton said. There’s really no conviction that the market has to go lower.”
(Watch: The red flag traders are watching in week ahead)
Newton thinks the NASDAQ will start to bottom out soon and then move upward. “We’re probably in stage for another four to six weeks of churning and probably a little bit of a rally,” Newton said. “The bigger pullback will probably postponed until late summer/early fall.”

If we can clear that level, it could signal more weakness for the euro or more optimism surrounding the U.S.”
In economic news, the flash read on the IHS Markit U.S. purchasing managers’ index hit 54.3 for February, falling slightly from January’s 14-month peak. The “latest survey data indicated that business optimism moderated among U.S. private sector firms in February, driven by weaker confidence across the service economy,” IHS said.

The spread between 10-year French bonds and their German counterpart ticked above 81 basis points Monday, hitting its highest level in about five years. “This shows that investors have no interest in holding French bonds and they are running towards German bonds,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets.U.S. equities kicked off the week on the right foot, closing at record highs Tuesday following a key naming by the Trump administration and corporate earnings.

The White House announced Monday that Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster will become the new national security advisor. McMaster replaces Michael Flynn, who resigned last week.
“This is very, very good for the market,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, adding McMaster’s naming helps assuage some of the concerns that President Donald Trump’s administration is in disarray.
Investors also digested several corporate quarterly results, including retail giants and . Macy’s posted mixed results, beating earnings per share estimates but falling short on sales, while Home Depot exceeded Wall Street expectations.
“The positive guidance out of Home Depot points to a buoyant consumer,” said Krosby.
Stocks — which also managed record levels last week — have been on a rip-roaring rally since the U.S. election, as investors have piled on to bets that the new administration will be able to enact significant corporate tax cuts and deregulation. The three large-cap indexes and the Russell have gained more than 10 percent since the election.
Following equities higher has been the U.S. dollar, which traded about half a percent higher against a basket of currencies, as market expectations for tighter monetary policy have increased.
“Although the current March hike madness theme could uplift the Dollar higher in the short term, the visible lack of commitment to a timeline in raising US rates may swiftly cap upside gains,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in a note.

Executives from Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop ring the closing bell at the Nasdaq MarketSite,EST-20184:27-PM,"Executives from Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand, Goop, are ringing the closing bell at the Nasdaq MarketSite on Friday. The company is in town to host a wellness summit, which encompasses panels of doctors and experts, and offers activities that range from acupressure to tarot card readings.
The brand was born in Paltrow’s kitchen almost ten years ago as a weekly newsletter. It’s since grown into a lifestyle website, a print magazine, clothing label, book imprint and more. It has almost 150 employees and an almost all-female C-suite.
The company has thrived for ten years, despite being called out for showcasing expensive products that some claim many of its readers can’t afford.
Overall revenues more than doubled from 2015 to 2016, and in 2017, it almost tripled its year-over-year revenue. Also in 2017, Goop’s own line of products grew six times year-over-year.
Gwyneth Paltrow was named CEO by the board in 2016.
‘In Goop Health’ is the company’s first summit in New York. There are two (sold out) packages. Depending on the package, ticket prices are either $650 per ticket or $2,000 per ticket. It held a version of the ‘In Goop Health’ summit in Los Angeles in June, 2017."

“It should be kept in mind that the ongoing Trump developments have heavily eroded investor risk appetite while political risks continue to weigh on global sentiment. Although the yellow metal remains slightly pressured on the daily charts, bulls could reclaim control if the $1220 regions defend,” Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said in a note.
Equities, along with the dollar and Treasury yields, have skyrocketed since Trump’s election on the prospects of more business friendly and reflationary policies.
“The rally yesterday in stocks after Trump said he will unveil a ‘phenomenal’ tax plan made sense because we wanted to see him focus on what was most important and not get distracted by other noise and tweets. There remains though the issue of what will be unveiled,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note.
In economic news, import prices rose 0.4 percent in January, more than the expected 0.2 percent increase. Export prices rose 0.1 percent last month, in line with estimates. preliminary consumer sentiment for February came in at 95.7, below the expected 98.5.

“Investors were worried that the tax plan was pushed to the backburner. Now, investors are celebrating that it’s not,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital.
The S&P 500 gained 0.36 percent, with energy, materials and industrials leading advancers. Lifting the energy sector were oil prices, as U.S. crude futures
for March delivery popped 1.6 percent to settle at $53.86 per barrel after the International Energy Agency reported that OPEC members’ cuts in January equated to 90 percent of the agreed volumes.
The market “continues to feed on itself. I think that part of the impetus is the S&P has confirmed a new all-time high, along with the Dow and Nasdaq,” said Daniel Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. He added that Trump’s initiatives “keep being received as positive.”
The Nasdaq composite gained about 0.33 percent. The three major indexes also posted weekly gains.

“When he said the words ‘phenomenal tax plan,’ that gave hope to the market that we were going to get a tax plan sooner,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “He basically spurred the market, saying he hasn’t forgotten about tax reform. That issue was at the core of the market’s embrace of Trump’s agenda, along with deregulation.”
Trump said Thursday in a meeting with airline executives that “lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league ... that’s coming along very well,” adding that an announcement would come over the next two or three weeks. Stocks climbed to record highs following those remarks.
“But who was in the market yesterday? Trading volume was low, and it was algorithms that were triggered immediately, lifting the market,” said Krosby, noting that trading desks were not as active in the northeast Thursday because of a snowstorm that hit the region.
Nevertheless, other asset classes also reacted to Trump’s remarks. Treasury yields and the dollar gained ground. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. 10 yield rose

It seems to want to go higher but every time it reaches the 2,108 level it breaks down.”

Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a note that “we expect upside follow-through in the days ahead to allow the SPX to break out from its triangle formation to a new all-time high. So far, earnings season is driving more breakouts on the charts than breakdowns, so we think it is only a matter of time before this is reflected by the major indices.”

Among the slew of industrial earnings reports before the bell, Caterpillar
surprised analysts by beating expectations on both earnings per share and revenue. The stock spiked 1.5 percent in morning trade.
CEO Doug Oberhelman said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that the United States was a bright spot in terms of construction growth. However, he said investors should not expect a repeat of this quarter. The firm raised its earnings forecast while maintaining its revenue outlook.
“I don’t extrapolate anything out of Caterpillar,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, noting negative reports from other industrials. “Not one of them is going to drive the market. ... It’s very much a mixed bag. The market is looking for direction and we may have to wait until next week’s Fed meeting.”

The big question on the horizon is Marine Le Pen,” said Tower Bridge’s Ogg. “If she wins, we’re going to have a recession.”
According to recent polls, Le Pen — France’s far-right, anti-European Union candidate — is the favorite to win the first round of voting, scheduled for April. However, it is not clear whether she will win the run-off vote in May.
Socialist Benoit Hamon and hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon held talks Friday about possibly joining forces to beat Le Pen. French bond yields ticked higher on the news, pushing the spread between 10-year French sovereigns and German bunds above 70 basis points.
However, “that simultaneously increases the chances for Le Pen to win because center-right voters might be more inclined to vote for her or not turn out,” said Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.

The three major indexes had posted record closing highs five straight sessions before closing mixed Thursday. Lifting stocks were the prospects of President Donald Trump presenting a “phenomenal” tax plan soon, as well as solid economic data.

Apple is driving the Nasdaq 100 – but can it keep its foot on the gas? Traders weigh in,EST-20174:12-PM,"The Nasdaq 100
has rallied more than 7 percent year to date, and just this week notched a record close, with the help of its largest component, Apple
.
With a weight in the index of about 12 percent, the tech giant has served as the biggest contributor to the Nasdaq 100 this year, adding nearly twice as much to the index as second-biggest contributor Facebook
.
So far this year, Apple has surged more than 14 percent, with the bulk of those gains coming after the company’s earnings report handily bested analysts’ expectations. Apple’s surge has been good for a roughly 1.7 percent rally in the large-tech index.
The outlook for Apple remains bullish, said Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global. But she’s looking for “innovation” from the company.
“Apple has been really undervalued for most of 2016. Apple has had high dividends, it has had good growth, and it has also had a great buyback program that has been buoying stocks. The problem going forward is that now that the move is done, now that you’ve gone from 10 times to 15 times earnings, where do you go from here?” Sanchez said Thursday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.”
“You really have to continue to see growth in Apple revenue, and the problem is they haven’t really unveiled anything really beyond new iPhones,” Sanchez added.
The company in its latest quarterly earnings release reported it sold more than 78 million iPhones, exceeding analysts’ expectations; the news sent the stock surging more than 6 percent. Apple is expected to release its next iPhone later this year.
“We don’t think it’s certainly overvalued, I mean it’s maybe a little overbought, but it’s certainly not overvalued where it is, but we need to see a reason to get excited for the next leg of growth,” Sanchez said.
While Apple is the Nasdaq 100 behemoth, Gibbs said investors shouldn’t neglect other tech heavies in the index.
“There’s still another 90 percent of weight of companies in the Nasdaq 100, and you get companies like Google
, Microsoft
. So I definitely see value in that diversification versus Apple that is really so tied to what it’s doing with its iPhone sales,” Gibbs said, adding that expectations for the newest iPhone are already quite high.
“You might want to look at what other companies are doing up until then,” Gibbs said.
Analysts currently give Apple an average rating of overweight, with an average price target of $140.70 on the now-$132 stock, according to FactSet estimates."

At the current levels, Friedlander thinks the S&P 500 is in the midpoint of a “significant” correction.
“Since the uptrend that began in 2011 was breached in August, we’ve been fairly confident that the SP500′s price path has a greater than most imagine probability of passing through the 1700′s before new highs are likely, and we continue to believe that SPX 1730 has a magnetic pull in a ‘can test, could hold’ kind of way,” Friedlander said in a note.
“If we’re right, 1730 would be a 38 percent retracement of wave three and, if it tests in Q4, there would also be potential support from the rising bottoms line which connects the 2009 and 2011 swing lows,” he warned.The following is a free preview of CNBC Pro.

The Nasdaq composite spooked investors on Monday after forming a death cross, a trading pattern that shows a decline in short-term momentum and is often a precursor to future losses.
A death cross occurs when the short-term moving average of a security or an index pierces below the long-term trend, in this case the 50-day moving average breaking through the 200-day moving average.
In the past month, similar chart patterns formed in the S&P 500, Dow and small-cap Russell 2000, but the Nasdaq avoided a death cross formation until Monday.
Among the major averages, the domino effect was progressively felt as the drop in one index preceded the next.
“The Dow Jones Industrial Average triggered the sell signal in August, followed by the S&P 500 then Russell 2000,” Brean Capital head of equity trading Roberto Friedlander wrote Monday, alluding to the deterioration in the market.

“We have the big names doing all of the lifting, and that, at some point, runs its course,” Worth said Friday on CNBC’s “Options Action.” “It’s very much a case of haves and have-nots, and that usually ends with lower prices for the aggregate.”After an impressive rally over the past month, the Nasdaq Composite is trading ever-closer to the all-time highs reached in early 2000 at the height of the tech bubble. But according to Sterne Agee chief market technician Carter Worth, the rally is not as healthy as it appears—which points the way to pain ahead.
The basic problem, according to Worth, is the rally is not “broad-based.” In other words, the Nasdaq is surging due to the strong moves of a few highly regarded stocks, such as Apple
, Microsoft
and Facebook
.
To illustrate this fact, Worth points out while the Nasdaq Composite
itself is up nearly 11 percent the year, the median stock is only up 0.35 percent, and the average stock is actually down 1.4 percent (as of Friday).
An even more striking fact is the 250 largest stocks by market cap are up 10 percent this year, while the 250 smallest stocks are down 22 percent this year. (Of course, included among the Nasdaq’s smallest stocks are some truly miserable picks, including companies that have announced non-reliance on financial statements or straight-up filed for bankruptcy).

In its last reported quarter, revenue jumped nearly 20 percent to more than $390 million, though the company posted a net loss of some $17 million as it spends money acquiring portfolios of towers from smaller rivals.
One catalyst that could move the stock higher: mobile growth overseas.
RBC analysts say Brazil represents a big opportunity given its fast growing population of more than 280 million mobile subscribers. SBA boasts some 7,000 towers there.

There are risks for investors to consider before committing capital to SBA. The potential of rising interest rates would make it more expensive for the company to finance continued acquisitions of smaller rivals.
More broadly, there is the possibility of carriers consolidating or dramatically cutting spending either domestically or overseas. Financial analysts covering SBA don’t foresee that happening, at least in the near term, and instead predict that the stock will move higher as long as there’s global demand for mobile data.
Investors will have a better sense of the company’s prospects when SBA reports fourth-quarter results on Friday. The company declined to comment, citing a quiet period before earnings.

Simply put, it’s a play on the explosion of mobile devices. In 2002, the iPhone didn’t even exist. Today, of course, there are countless consumers using smartphones and tablets. That means carriers need to lease more antenna space from SBA to meet growing demand for mobile data.
“Whether you’re using an iPad, iPhone or Android device, the tower companies are needed by every single carrier at this point in the U.S., and abroad for that matter,” said Michael Bowen, a senior research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities."
